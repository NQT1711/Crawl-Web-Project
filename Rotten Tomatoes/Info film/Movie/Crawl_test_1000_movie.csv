It really makes almost zero sense.  Especially the whole hospital/jazz bar/bum park/wharf thing.  And the remote-control cop thing.  And then the live dogs sewn into live humans thing.

Except the reveal of the murderer.  I knew who the murderer was pretty much the whole time.  I'm not sure if that was the point or not.  Was there a point?

Once again there's no dialogue, but it works much better this time round because we have more to absorb and feel. The main characters ordeal is brought to us with striking visuals and a beautifully fitting musical score. At less than half an hour long it might be viewed as more of a time filler, and isn't the kind of thing you could watch repeatedly, but as a one-off experience, it's clever, well-made and surprisingly emotional. It's the type of picture more people should be talking about, and many more should be enjoying.<>Cerda finishes strong with a piece about mourning. It's well-shot and the most affective of the trilogy, showing grief and loss in detail, instead of the sterile Aftermath or drab, grayscale Awakening.<>Genesis is a haunting tale of love, death and dedication in a sorta Twlight Zone kinda way.
It's a much better experience than I had with Cerda's previous effort Aftermath and it leaves me wanting to see it again right after I just finished it.

This one is captivating, beautiful, and really sentimental. It tells the story of a sculptor whose wife died in a car accident and so he creates her full body sculpture to maintain her presence in his life, even in this way. Still this is not enough to fill the emptiness of his heart and soon the man experiences changes along with his wife's sculpture. At a certain point the viewer is uncertain whether he hallucinates or actually going through certain events. 

Its not gory, but its emotionally charged and through it we see a different site of Cerdà, and I can't wait to see what he will do next. Highly recommended ;)<>If you never seen a horror film that features necrophilia and your disturbed by it, then don't watch this movie.

Yumeji,,82,1 Reviews,100+ Ratings,,upright,Biography,Japanese,Seijun Suzuki,Yôzô Tanaka,"Mar 7, 2006",2h 8m,The life of Japanese artist and poet Yumeji Takehisa.,"Kenji Sawada, Tomoko Mariya, Masumi Miyazaki, Tamasaburo Bando, Yoshio Harada, Kazuhiko Hasegawa, Leona Hirota, Seijun Suzuki, Yôzô Tanaka, Genjiro Arato, Shigeru Umebayashi, Junichi Fujisawa, Akira Suzuki, Noriyoshi Ikeya",Yumeji ultimately emerges as less an expression of a worldview than of a restless prankster still delighting in pulling the rug from beneath his audience's feet.,"The last film of Taisho trilogy in a very surrealistic tone tells a story of Japanese painter and poet Takahisa Yumeji (1884-1934) encountering several mistresses and his rival artist Gyoshu Inomura who is arguably more talented than Yumeji (portrayed by Kenji Savada). Throughout the account on the screen, we get a glance on the psychological and art struggles of the painter who is seeking the perfection and inspiration for his paintings.

The tantalizing tale is enhanced with numerous surrealistic forms, characters, images and entire scenes. It is also impossible to follow the stream of the tale before we get an idea we bump into the artistic fantasies of Yumeji, and the line between the death-life and reality-fiction is painted by Yumeji himself. The bizarre work of camera moving from the left to the right, and back again and showing the scenes with unusual composition and angles illustrate this far-fetched definition of different dimensions which unite and mix up in Yumeji's mind. The story contains both surrealistic scenes and detective-like motif, though It is not entirely clear whether Wakiya (played by Yoshio Harada) has been actually murdered or not, and it is unclear if the whole story ever took place in the reality. The endless riddles bridge the gap between Suzuki and BuÃ±uel with Robbe-Grillet.

What is certain is that the film tells about Yumeji's perception of the art and women which are pretty much related in his life. There is no mood for art without passion Yumeji chases women with. He encounters the most beautiful ladies and seduces them, but he doesn't love them in a human way. His fetish is about their postures, outfits, behavoiur is utilized for the ideas of paintings, and the women's beauty for him is nothing but inspiration for art and poetry. He feeds himself on their boundless sexuality and allure like a vampire, and he is so addicted to their beauty that women, in fact, define his art. We see Yumeji is in the relationships with a woman who loves him, but the artistical mindset makes him seduce the other women as potential models or nudies.

Seijun Suzuki shows the gorgeous women and their perfect bodies in abundance to immerse himself and viewers in Yumeji's fetish (and probably the director's fetishism as well). The scenes with Tomoyo (played by Tomoko Mariya) and Hikono (Masumi Miyazaki) are charged with the enthralling sexuality the female protagonists radiate. They are frequently shot as the paintings, and this images strike with the boundless beauty Yumeji and the viewers fully immerse into. This is a very sexy and surreal fantasy which resembles Alain Robbe-Grillet's L'Eden et aprÃ¨s in an artistic way and Trans-Europ Express by the manner of storytelling. The usage of aggressive montage and dense colours reminds of the style of La Chinoise by Jean-Luc Godard.

To sum up, Yumeji is a set of fetish fantasies made like a collection of his paintings he could have possibly completed. Every shot is like a painting where mise-en-scene stuns with beauty and bizarre mesmerizing power. The story is hard to follow and riddles might be very confusing, but it can be interpreted in many ways. Yumeji is important and striking as an art object and surrealistic experiment, yet there is probably no way to delve too deep into the film: it is much better to enjoy the sophisticated shots and the beauty of Yumeji's mistresses portrayed by Tomoko Mariya, Masumi Miyazaki, and Reona Hirota. The last but not the least thing is the usage of music. This is the film Shigeru Umebayashi has written his brilliant and sublime music theme Yumeji for. Later the same theme would find international acclaim after being remarkably used in the film of Wong Kar-wai In the Mood for Love.<>my favorite of the 'trilogy"", this movie was totally beautiful, a beautiful score as well, the characters and events - which seem secondary to mood, visuals, motif and set pieces - all seem to repeat or some how fold in on themselves in a dream like way.  Very good film.<>Absurdist masterpiece Yumeji stands out among Seijun Suzukis voluminous production as his most daring work. Inspired by symbolist painters such as Beardsley, the film is a virtual visual feast. Notorious rockstar Kenji Sawada is a perfect fit as the somewhat scandalous real-life painter Yumeji Takehisa. A superb soundtrack by Shigeru Umebayashi.<>""Yumeji"" aparentemente es una película de fantasmas. 
Es lo que he leído yo en la carátula después de haber terminado de ver la película. 
Y me he dicho: [I]¡Ah!, claro, eran fantasmas[/I].
Más allá de este importante detalle, sigo sin enterarme de mucho. 

El director es Seijun Suzuki, y con este nombre quizás aclare más las cosas. 

La película, del año 1991, rebosa de simbolismo. De ese del que abusan muchas películas japonesas. El espectador poco iniciado puede ver fantasmas, pero también pueden ser pesadillas, sueños, visiones o lo que uno quiera. ¿Qué más da? 
Llenos o llenas de mujeres con rostros demasiado parecidos, pinturas, kimonos, lagos, lluvia, muerte, suicidio, sake, baños, cortejos, tatamis, oscuridad, ... donde también aparece un coche, un teléfono y una estación de tren... En este caso parece que nos quieren decir que ya estamos en el Japón de Taisho. Nada ha cambiado, pero las nenas ya empiezan a darle al teléfono y a usar los coches para hacer cositas (esto último es un decir). 

En fin, un entretenimiento estético, más de dos horas, que se hace largo, pesado, pero con planos y con ideas que sólo se pueden ver en las películas del señor Suzuki (o al menos en las tres que he visto yo de este señor). 

En realidad he visto ""Yumeji"" esta extraña mañana de domingo porque ayer me encontré con el señor Suzuki por la calle. Y lo menos que podía hacer era hacerle este pequeño homenaje. 

Sí, me lo encontré en la calle. Iba yo hacia el cine Nouveau, en Kujo, para ver qué se cuece por allí ahora, y comprobé que ayer mismo empezaba un ciclo enteramente dedicado a él. Estamos de suerte. Sólo hace falta animarse. 

Aquí está el link: 

http://www.cinenouveau.com/cinemalib2007/seijun/seijyun2.html

Fementido les recomienda ferviertemente acudir al menos a una de sus películas. Que sean las películas en japonés, sin subtítulos, no es excusa suficiente en este caso. Las películas de Suzuki valen mucho más por sus imágenes y por sus juegos de cámara, que nos conducen la mirada a lugares que no esperábamos ver. Especialmente a partir de finales de los años 60. Historias de violencia, de jóvenes, de artistas. Una buena manera de darse cuenta de que lo que vemos todos los días en la calle bien puede ser también una historia de fantasmas, solo que en este caso la película no viene acompañada con una carátula aclaratoria.",,,,,,,,
General Cemetery,,8,0 Reviews,Fewer than 50 Ratings,,spilled,Horror,Spanish,Dorian Fernández-Moris,Javier Velásquez,"Apr 4, 2017",1h 28m,A grieving teenager unleashes a series of terrifying events when she tries to contact her deceased father using a Ouija board.,"Marisol Aguirre, Airam Galliani, Jürgen Gömez, Nico Ponce, Leslie Shaw, Dorian Fernández-Moris, Luis Fernández, Javier Velásquez",Không có review của nhà phê bình,"El otro día pude por fin ir a ver la película Cementerio General. Similar a lo ocurrido con Asu Mare, las salas para ver esta cinta estaban totalmente llenas de gente, por lo que tuve que esperar un poco para poder verla con más tranquilidad.
Ya se puede decir que ha sido un éxito de taquilla, eso sin duda es de felicitar ya que si existe gran cantidad de público que va a ver películas nacionales y sobre todo aquellas que abordan temas distintos a los tan agotadores dramas de la época del terrorismo y demás, los productores se van a animar a seguir produciendo mas. Esto es súper importante porque es la experiencia en el rubro lo que va a favorecer a una mejor calidad en las producciones, queriéndose superar con cada película nueva. Por eso es vital que la gente siga asistiendo a las salas de cine.
Un punto a destacar de Cementerio General es que tenemos por primera vez una película de terror hecha en el Perú, algo que juega a doble filo, ya que si bien me llamó mucho la atención la simple idea de romper el molde, temía que caiga en los ""cliches"" de las películas de este género.
Un rápido argumento es que un grupo de chicos decide reunirse una noche para realizar una Ouija. El motivo es el de querer contactar al padre de Andrea (Ariam Galliani) quien ha fallecido hace poco, por lo que desean contactarlo para poder despedirse de él. Los acompañan Evita (Flavia Trujillo), Gabriel (Nikko Ponce), Mayra (Diva Rivera), Pablo (Jürgen Gómez), Julio (César Menéndez), quienes van a sufrir grandes momentos de angustia cuando las cosas se les salgan de las manos.
Como pueden ver, desde un principio la trama ya es masomenos predecible, sin embargo siempre se puede dar sucesos inesperados para mantener la conexión con el público.
El Cementerio es presentado apenas empieza la película, lo que en particular a mi me pareció que fue demasiado rápido, creo que se pudo haber generado un tono más de expectativa, trabajar una escena un poco más larga y lenta, si bien el objetivo era presentarnos el momento de un entierro, creo que para envolvernos con el misterio y la tensión, debes dejar al público pensar un buen rato en lo que está viendo, en cada detalle que aparece en pantalla. No solamente mostrarle rápidamente lo que sucede.
El trabajo de la fotografía estuvo aceptable, sin embargo ciertas tomas creo que pudieron ser mejor hechas. Ejemplo: Cuando meten el ataúd en el pozo, la cámara filma justo desde arriba en ángulo recto, pero a medida que se aleja se va curvando hacia la derecha, por lo que el momento que aparece el título, queda una toma rara y chueca, pudiendo mantener una toma perfecta a 90 grados y perfectamente centrada. Ese tipo de detalles son muy importantes.
Sin embargo este tipo de análisis de encuadres y demás se da poco, ya que en su mayoría de escenas la película cuenta con un estilo de ""cámara libre"", al estilo de Las Brujas de Blair, Cloverfield y muchas películas de guerra últimamente. Por lo que la consigna era: ""Mueve la cámara todo lo que puedas"", ""vamos a abusar excesivamente del desenfoque y problemas técnicos por el electromagnetismo causado por los fantasmas"".
Los efectos de sonido abundaron y quizá se les paso un poco la mano. Ruidos, pasos, voces llamando a los personajes, risas lejanas y gritos por todos lados.
Hago un paréntesis para aclarar que yo nunca fui mucho de películas de terror, porque en los últimos años no he visto buenas producciones de este género, con sustos muy predecibles o simplemente no me terminan de envolver con sus historias. Por eso no crean que esto es una crítica a ""Cementerio General como película peruana"" sino más bien son las mismas críticas que hago todo el tiempo a las películas de terror.
Hablando de los sustos predecibles, si aquellos que empiezan con un momento de absoluto silencio, una larga pausa, evidenciando claramente que va a aparecer algo de la nada con un gran BOOOOOO!!!! Si, esos mismos, estuvieron presentes también acá y la verdad que los puedes adivinar muy fácilmente. Obviamente nunca faltaran algunas chicas en la sala que van a gritar desesperadas. ¡Y CLARO QUE LAS HUBO!
Ahora otra cosa que sorprendió bastante fue la de algunas actuaciones, la linda Ariam Galliani tiene un gran futuro en la actuación, bueno después de todo su papá, el popular y grande Sergio Galliani la debe asesorar muy bien. Por otro lado la actriz Diva Ribera, en el papel de Mayra, tampoco lo hizo nada mal, sobre todo en los momentos previos a entrar al Cementerio, cuando empiezan los diálogos más complejos sobre los espíritus y demás ya se pierde el realismo y pasa a ser un dialogo aprendido. En general casi todos tuvieron buenas actuaciones (con excepción de Leslie Shaw que simplemente fue un método de marketing para traer más gente a las salas, sobre todo hombres que esperaban verla en alguna escena candente; y por otro lado Marisol Aguirre que nunca me voy a tragar su actuación de telenovela). Incluso el actor Nikko Ponce me termino cayendo bien en su papel del payaso de la película.
Ahora he aquí el gran problema de la cinta, del cual deriva el título de este artículo. MAS QUE PELÍCULA DE TERROR, ME FUI A VER UNA TREMENDA COMEDIA. Y no solo lo digo por mí, literalmente casi toda la sala estallaba en risas en varios momentos, en VARIOS. Y no es para nada culpa de los actores, sino es plenamente un trabajo de los guionistas y el director. NO PUEDES hacer una broma en los momentos que intentas generar la tensión y la intriga, a menos que sea el final de una escena para pasar a otra más ligera, como para ""romper el hielo"" pero cuando estas a mitad de una secuencia de terror, NO DEBES GENERAR RISAS DE NINGÚN TIPO. Creo que el único momento que sentí escalofríos fue cuando me percaté que habían puesto muy fuerte el aire acondicionado de la sala de cine.
Y por último, luego del cementerio suceden otras cosas, que a mi parecer fue innecesario, quisieron alargar el terror un poco más, creo que se debió explicar mejor como terminaron las cosas en el cementerio. Porque las últimas escenas se fueron hacia lo ridículo de las historias de terror.
Bueno, recuerden que este es mi punto de vista, las películas de terror nunca fueron mis favoritas porque no me llama la atención el terror predecible que se es tan acostumbrado últimamente. Sin embargo creo que géneros como estos en el Perú se pueden trabajar mucho más y seguir mejorándolo para llegar a mejores resultados. Es un buen comienzo, lo dice la taquilla, ahora está en manos de los productores a seguir con el siguiente paso.

So when you hear that everyone and their uncle is making a 3D film, you immediately jump in the race with an age-old, done to death script merely to beat others? Surely, the production process must have been a challenging job, but is that a fair reason in the neglecting the significance of script?

The story remains almost on the same theme as earlier but this times it come with the 3d effect. The movie visually is very appealing with all the make ups and effects. It lacks on the verge on sound effects. The music of the movie is good and blends with the proceeding movie. Being the first stereoscopic horror movie it achieves and manages to thrill the audience. It has some scary moments and the 3d effect enhances them on a vast scale. The romantic side is well stuffed in. The 3d effects are commendable.

Unfortunately, she isn't up to the task.<>Shailene Woodley shows no fear diving on and off a boat in rugged seas; like the rest of the crew she battled open-water threats including seasickness and sunburn to create believable intensity of a real experience...<>What is meant to be a voyage of self-discovery is actually little more than a trip to the Young Adult section of the library.<>Ultimately, Adrift was a nice enough way to pass two hours, it never left us completely bored and it was easy popcorn fodder.<>I didn't expect much going in Adrift. Maybe an escapist thriller with a decent lead performance. I ended up getting a lot out of it.<>Woodley is an absolute blast to watch in the film's most adventurous scenes.<>The longer we're at sea, we the audience begin to drift, craving the danger of ""Open Water"" or the imagination of ""Life of Pi.""<>A one-woman crewed voyage of grit and determination, one that frequently gets lost in its convoluted storyline.<>There are two stories playing out almost simultaneously -- each independently intriguing, but seemingly completely separate from each other.<>Director Baltasar Kormákur . . . exacerbates manners by approaching the film with the same pace throughout, making sequences indiscernible from each other in rhythm and beats.<>If you're feeling adventurous and looking for another kind of superhero in a crowded field, this might be for you.<>A movie with the structure of Adrift has to live and die by the quality/believability of both its action and setting, and right off the bat it's clear that both will be handled well.<>A film just as much about the freewheeling Kerouac-ian liberation of travel as a romance. The predictable plot machinations are hardly a detriment.<>Adrift is a solid, midrange picture of the type that is increasingly rare. It's star-driven, suspenseful, and just plain gorgeous to look at.<>Unfortunately, the film's survival aspect is not as compelling as other films of the same nature.<>The production could have fallen into the trap of being another run-of-the-mill feature about a love story... But, Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur shook things up a bit with more of an indie art-house style.<>[Shailene Woodley] gives an intrepid performance in a physically demanding role that places her onscreen the entire 1 hour and 36-minute runtime.<>If it's not quite as exciting as watching Blake Lively square off against a particularly pesky shark in The Shallows from two summers ago, there's still enough of interest to keep the new nautical drama Adrift afloat.","The acting is terrible, the script poorly written, the sailing unrealistic.  This is a story about two of the worst sailors on the entire earth, poorly executed in every way.<>Feeling cheated by the ending. The plot made us think both surived and suddenly it was only Tami. If I had known this earlier I'd never started viewing the movie or turned off halfways.<>Pretty good. Not extremely original or anything but it's still touching. The simplicity of it all, it's slow but also interesting pace, the beautiful longing, loss, travel and trauma at. So beautifully and simply painted into a movie<>This film is an easy watch I suppose but I didn't feel it really 'worked' for me. First off, it keeps swapping chronology, in as much as in one scene the main characters are getting to know each other, excited by the prospects of sailing to many exciting parts of the world etc. and moments later, we're shown the characters trying to deal with the stark situation their faced with, trying to survive on the boat unable to run properly. I felt frustrated that it seemed like we (the viewer) aren't given all the details about what happened beforehand, what precisely led to the scenario we're shown near the start, until much later on. Of course, I suppose thats the intriguing bit, what the filmmakers hope you'll keep watching for but it didn't really appeal to me greatly. Personally, I tend to prefer a more traditional timeline in films, as I find myself imagining me being in the characters shoes, wondering what will happen next and so on.

Also, there's the aspect that the main characters are (I assume) fairly comfortably well off, so during scenes of them talking about their hopes and likes etc., I can't say I felt particularly bothered about whether they achieved those goals or not, given a lot of people likely never get the chance to try and achieve them but thats not to say that I didn't feel sorry for them at all when things took the inevitable turn for the worse. I felt distinctly lukewarm about this but the acting is decent enough and I wouldn't say I wasn't at all curious about what happened to them ultimately - the sense of perserverance this film contains is admirable. Plus there's also the fact that it is based on a true story I believe and I do like films based on true stories, there's no doubt about that. Its an interesting watch but I'm not sure I'd specifically recommend it as such, unless your really interested in the story.<>I thought it was good overall and an interesting look at the true events that transpired with the journey of Tami & Richard on their yacht as they hit hurricane weather.<>Engaging from the very first frame this drama based on Tami Oldham Ashcraft's real-life survival story places the viewer in some very challenging situations. With excellent special effects we are taken out to sea, then tested beyond the expected limits of endurance - to survive the awesomeness posed by the cradle of life - the sea in all its splendor and ferocity.  Shailene Woodley (also Co-producer) and Sam Claflin are marvelous as newly engaged lovers, employed to transport a luxury Yacht back to its destined port. 

What follows is a harrowing voyage, a challenge to arrive at any destination whatsoever, alive.  Cinematography by multiple Award-winner Robert Richardson adds enormously.  Water is a difficult element to work with and recreate but this better than average survival story, coupled with an honest, engagingly told approach, features a striking revelation of the human spirit at its close.  Highly recommended.<>It is a bit hard to describe why I am rating this movie so high without getting into spoilers. I was prepared to give this movie 3 stars until the last thirty minutes, but the ending surprised me. It surprised me with what was happening on screen, and it surprised me because it made me truly feel for the character.

Rating - Good<>Trama non particolarmente originale, anche se raramente è capitato di poterla elaborare con una chiave romantica spiccata.

Bad movie!<>I got maybe half way through and thought ""life is too short"" to try to make entertainment out if this, stopped it and hit erase from DVR.<>IN A NUTSHELL:

Romance rekindles for Peyton and her closest friends during a holiday-themed reunion that Peyton's parents decide to host in their family-owned summer camp before selling it.  The Hallmark movie was written by Anna White and directed by David I. Strasser.

If you want Christmas cheer in July with a family-friendly story, this one is for you.  If you can't handle the over-the-top saccharine of Hallmark movies and how everything is always tied up with a pretty bow at the end, you definitely won't like this.



THINGS I LIKED:

The cast includes Tori Anderson, Corbin Bleu, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, Caitlin Stryker, Matt Hamilton, Alec Santos, Iris Quinn, Fred Henderson, and a young cast that plays their characters when they were teens.
There are a lot of flashbacks, utilizing both casts of characters fully.
As an author of 31 books, I always enjoy movies that feature writers and publishers.  I love seeing how other authors go through their process and what inspires them.
Dance number!  ha ha
The movie is clean and appropriate for family viewing.
I was hoping the dialogue and scenario would be more realistic, but it's not a terrible thing to say this movie is too happy and perfect.

 

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:

The dialogue is very cheesy.
There are some cringe-worthy acting moments.  Most of the characters are just too smiley all the time.
The humor is just silly, nothing laugh-out-loud funny.
There's not very much romantic chemistry among any of the couples.
The adults act a lot like giggly teens.   Example dialogue:  ""You KISSED?""  – woman 1     ""And it was a good one!""  – woman 2
It felt very old-fashioned.  This movie would have been a big hit in the 1950s.
 



TIPS FOR PARENTS:    

A gay couple hugs and almost kisses
Other couples kiss
No profanity
Jealousy is portrayed
Friendly competitive games and behavior
 



THEMES:

Family
Traditions
Friendship
Romance
Memories
Community
Retirement
Rivalry
First love
Second chances
Reunion<>just bad. the acting, the premise.. the only reason it has a half star is because of the gays.<>Too many people, too much going on, too much laughing. Could not warm up to anyone in the cast. I prefer 1-2 plots.",Charles Cooper,,,,TVG,,,

I think perhaps that we are meant to identify with Claire Trevor's character.  After all, we meet her first, when she is getting her divorce in Reno and then slowly find out about her life (engagement to wealthy Fred and dependence on rich foster sister Georgia).  But the film becomes increasingly absorbed by the unusual personality of Sam Wild (played by a young Lawrence Tierney who was later known by my generation as the crime boss in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs).  Sam is basically a sociopath (or a psychopath) - he is quick to anger, impulsive, and a great believer in his own abilities and entitlements.  He won't let anyone make a monkey out of him.  So, after murdering a couple of people, he bends the plot to his own needs and desires - and he has a strong influence on Trevor's Helen, warping her significantly.  Of course, it ends badly, due partly to the efforts of Walter Slezak (from Lifeboat) and his cheap though sophisticated private dick.

Written by Rob Riley, Andrew Kurtzman (both writers from Saturday Night Live), Gail Morgan Hickman (Murphy's Law and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown) and James Belushi — yes, the James Belushi — and directed by Jack Smight (No Way to Treat a Lady, The Illustrated Man, Damnation Alley), this is the story of two cops, the borderline psychotic Nick ""Berserk"" Barzack (Carradine) and smooth jazz playing ladies' man Frank Hazeltine (Williams).

Not many buddy cop movies have the cops dealing with one of their relationships with their mother and ex-wife, who are played by Doris Roberts and Valerie Bertinelli. And in case you're wondering why Belushi wasn't in this, it turns out that his schedule was too busy, so they called in Carradine.

Hey! Peters Graves is in this! And John Gries! Man, John Gries, you're in so much stuff that no one gives you credit for, making movies like Real Genius better as Lazlo, Joysticks as King Vidiot, O.D. in TerrorVision, you steal the show as Louie in Fright Night 2, you're great as the wolfman in Monster Squad and yeah, everyone knows you were in Napoleon Dynamite but those roles, man — you've done so much with them.

And yes, if you have mud wrestling or any wrestling in your movie made in the 70s or 80s, Gene LeBell must legally be in it.<>Partners track a drug ring linked to a very influential man within the city. The expected trappings of the buddy cop film are here, you shouldn't expect too much originality with a Cannon offering. Decent chemistry between Billy Dee and Carradine aside, this may not have quite reached its full potential.<>Average action film from the Cannon Group, who was just exiting a great run producing the best action films in the industry.  Here we have two cops using their own methods to take down a drug ring.  The Golan-Globus budgets were not yet significantly cut as evidenced by the airplane and helicopter aerial dog fight.  Billy Dee Williams always offers some value add.<>Back in the 1980's when life was simple and a movie could be made and thrown into theaters for under a million dollars, you didn't really have to put a lot of effort into them in order to make them profitable. Cannon Films were the king of that kind of shoddy filmmaking, and ""Number One With a Bullet"" is one of their laziest police thrillers ever.

It throws in every police buddy picture cliche you can think of, from the estranged wife to the surprise twist involving a dirty cop, and the threadbare plot was pieced together from dozens of films that came before. Apparently Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris were off somewhere filming the five movies they would release under the Cannon banner in 1987, so here we get the ragtag team of Robert Carradine and Billy Dee Williams. Both are totally wrong for their respective roles as you never buy them as these hardened career officers for an instance, and the actors have little chemistry together.

The one-liners are tired and there's not one surprise or original thought to be found. The movie does have more unnecessary sub-plots than we're used to, such as Doris Roberts as Carradine's doting mother, and it has the worst score I
ve heard in a cop thriller in a long time. The background music never has anything to do with what's going on in the film. There's also a lot more plot than action. The action sequences are confined to a few routine car chases and shootouts.

Everything about ""Number One With a Bullet"" is vaguely familiar, and not much of it is worth seeing again. It's forgotten about as quickly as it's over with.<>Cop action, with laughs 80's style<>Another good Duo and another slightly funny film.

As you assume Billy immediately pushes him into films although his heart is else where. It's a moral film with a message of what's important.

It has a few nice moments but it's nothing amazing but has it's place...it's always good to learn some new Billy Crystal one liners.<>A year after the mess that was Father's Day Billy Crystal returned with another stinker and, while this one isn't quite as awful, it's still pretty stinkin' bad. 

Inspired by his experience meeting Andre the Giant during The Princess Bride, Crystal plays a third rate talent agent struggling to get by. While on assignment in Romania, he gets in a car accident and is saved by a gentle giant named Max who clocks in at nearly 8 feet tall (NBA player Gheorghe Muresan is 7'7""). 

Seeing a lot of promise in him, Crystal's Sammy tries his best to get Max into the big time, and salvage what's left of his failing career and life. 

As you might expect, there's a lot of hurdles to get through, and of course, being a scheming weasel, Sammy has some tough lessons to learn about life and humanity. 

This really could have been a sincere, earnest, and good film. Unfortunately it's handled with little subtlety, originality, and nuance, so the end result is really trite, predictable, and cringe worthy. 

As a dramedy it's really not all that funny, and the dramatic elements more often than not fall flat and come off as disingenuous and unearned. I'll admit that the Catholic jokes at the monastery and the stuff with Steven Seagal worked and were funny, and I liked a few of the dramatic bits, but overall this was fairly insufferable. I hated the gawking, the obvious routes the film went, and the generally exploitative nature of the proceedings. I felt bad for Muresan, and hope they paid him well for all the stuff done at his expense. 

Had there been a stronger script, better execution, and a lot more tact, humanity, and heart, then yeah, maybe I'd be on board here. But instead this is shameful, dull, and has almost nothing worthwhile to offer.<>Parfois, un scenario aussi sympathique et reussi que celui-ci ne peut etre gache par une realisation academique.

This movie was very touching and sweet. Billy Crystal stars as this movie agent who travels to Romania on work errands only to discover that he has been fired from his job. He gets into a car accident and gets pulled out of the vehicle by this giant man (in his eyes a guardian angel).

But somewhere between endearing tale it switches to Crystals Character abusing his new found friend for personal gain and exposing a man's Giant stature for profit. Lucky by the final cut Crystal realizes his selfish motives to be wrong and makes an effort to become a changed man (too late in the game sort to speak).<>eah after recently thinking about it, I think it's time that my ratings are changed a little so it's not just either 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 etc and make it so i could also rate the movies as 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, etc. Probably overdue but better late than never. But anyway, here's the first video from the bag which is this drama comedy that was co-written and starred by Billy Crystal: My Giant.


Plot: Sam is an agent who just got fired by his current client who is shooting a film in Romania. While leaving the set he crashed his car and is saved by a 8 foot tall Romanian man named Max. Sam gets the idea to make Max a star, so he convinces the director to cast Max as the villain in the movie. From there, Sam tries to get him more roles and along with it, help Max find his old paramour he had 20 years ago.

Now if  you are wondering if this movie is not very creative when it comes to the concept of the story. A) Don't finish reading this review yet if you don't want to know until you've seen it because B) I'm just going to say it for those who don't really care or have already seen this film: yes, it's not a creative concept. Quite honestly, I wasn't very amused very much with a lot of the first...15 minutes give a take of this film because if you've seen enough movies like this film, you know exactly what is going to happen. Also I have to say that it really isn't much of a comedy. Because I heard one or two things that were cute, but that was really it. It mostly stayed a drama. But...when you get to the last 40 ish minutes the drama is a little nice. I mean don't get me wrong, the whole story in general is just plain cheesy, but the drama is still a little...nice. I mean it's still dumb in terms of creativity, but you could be interested in the characters enough to enjoy it anyway.

Actors/Characters:
Billy Crystal/Sam: He was just okay. Like I said, they really do much with the comedy and that pretty much went the exact same way with Billy Crystal in this movie. But his part in the drama later on did make his character a little more interesting or at least more like someone we could care for than being the person he introduced to us in the beginning.
Muresan/Max: He was nice. His character wasn't original, but if you do like a story about a nice giant like Max, he did do well enough that I think you would easily enjoy him.

Music: I didn't really pay attention to the music much. I mean it's a drama/comedy with Billy Crystal, so there really isn't anything that stands out as a score either good or bad for that kind of movie.

Editing: The editing was okay. There were one or two cuts that I didn't really think were necessary, but for the general part, they did good.

And that's my review for My Giant. It's a very cheesy film that while they lack a lot of comedy, the drama in the film no matter how cheesy it is could make it nice enough that you could like anyway.<>a marvolest and hillarious comedy that proves size dosen't matter.

Kakabakaba ka ba? (Will Your Heart Beat Faster?),,88,0 Reviews,100+ Ratings,,upright,,,Mike de Leon,,,,,"Christopher De Leon, Charo Santos-Concio, Jay IlaganSandy Andolong, Johnny Delgado, Mike de Leon",Không có review của nhà phê bình,"Laugh out loud, hilarious absurd comedy. The entire audience was in stitches.<>There are a couple of interesting ideas, but on the whole, it's a haphazard mess of unfunny slapstick, pointless chases, and random illogical developments.<>The fumbles of the Yakuza. The desperate awkwardness of Chinese determination. The insidious depiction of Catholic nuns and priests. I think it's a great decision for Mike De Leon, one of the best directors there ever were in the Philippines, to put a film prioritizing such themes in a not-so-serious environment where anyone at anytime (although especially in the climax) can break into production numbers. In spirit, ""Kakabakaba Ka Ba?"" is, like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", an unexpectedly bizarre adventure into the illegal and the unknown for two uninitiated couple, or at least, love birds. But in its entirety as a film, it is a sharp satire about how these underworld dwellers seem to have all the fun in the world, forming sinister plans, dancing their way into drug production and superficially praising God's daily bread. 

And with a sense of bumbling lack of control, the film has expressed these mindless chases for grotesque pleasures and  taboo in a happy, energetic and strangely harmonious light that we question its unusual tone. But I believe De Leon and screenwriters Doy Del Mundo and Racquel Villavicencio knew more. That 'question' makes the film. It evaluates our response to its display of romanticized moral disregard. With quirkiness, music and a slip-in psychedelia on the side. 

The film's MacGuffin is unique enough: a cassette tape cum opium container. It was unwittingly put into one of our protagonists' (played by Christopher De Leon) jacket by the Yakuza errand man Omota, one-dimensionally played by APO's Boboy Garovillo (although may be the exact intent). Through that performance, it transforms foreign smuggling into a Wile Coyote-like affair, with occasional busts and foils treated as nothing but episodic humor and successes immediately countered by funny miscalculations. In an early scene, the film even pokes fun to the fatal culture of the said Japanese crime syndicate when failure hits the fan through cutting of fingers. Shown in a flat screen television sticking out from a Shoji screen. The film's tongue was really that immersed on the cheek.

The lovebirds mentioned earlier were played by Christopher De Leon, Jay Ilagan, Charo Santos and Sandy Andolong. Their performances were quite enjoyable, but that's where the script shows its contrivance. At certain points, they ride into dialogues not by means of natural flow but through conversational timings that were obviously rehearsed and coordinated. At least they could have applied some of Bunuel's passively comic treatments to satiric characters that were always proven to be very effective. But still, I have to praise Mike De Leon and company for creating such a different film in our local industry that seems to live and die on melodrama. 

By the standards of our movies, ""Kakabakaba Ka Ba?"" is utterly subversive, with radical attacks ranging from gangsterism to the Catholic church's hypocrisy, while it also brought forth a notion that musical can quite fit as a narrative crescendo to such a wide-tackling satire. But maybe it's also an easy way to visually portray what they really wanted to: The crazy, megalomania-inspired higher ones' intent to control people through the, symbolically, 'opiate of the masses' that is mainstream religion, as coined by Karl Marx (furthered by how Pinoy Master (Johnny Delgado) wants to produce mass wafers mixed with opium to be given to church-goers). So, after all, there's some ounces of critical inputs in the film, too. 

I must admit, I did not like ""Kakabakaba Ka Ba?"" that much compared to Mike De Leon's masterpiece ""Kisapmata"", arguably the best Filipino film ever made, and ""Batch '81"". But I love the way the film has ended. Dancing nuns. A Singing drug kingpin. A samurai duel. With a unique approach to the final wedding scene, the film embraced some sort of a Jodorowskian afterthought.

Amidst a two hour run of exhilarating, fantastical imagery, a crew, holding a clapper, suddenly shouts ""Cut!"" and the camera zooms out from above, exposing the band playing the musical score to only be a few feet away from the actual scene. It fully echoes Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""Holy Mountain"" and its most memorable character, the Alchemist's immortal line: ""Real life awaits us"". Well, let's break the illusion then, shall we?",,,,,,,,

The journey to these games are through to young North Korean school girls & therefore getting a glimpse of North Korean lifestyle in the city which is far from the truth in the rural areas.

The scope & size of the Mass Games is hard to believe since the country is in such poverty. This chronicles the days up to the games & incredibly Kim Jong II doesn't even attend, so in many ways your left feeling very disappointed, but it gives you great insight to North Korea.<>""A state of mind"" is a great documentary that gives a very rare peek into the daily lives of two families in central Pyongyang, during the days leading up to the 2003 Mass Games. The information here may be outdated (since it showed the quotidian during Kim Jong Il's regime instead of today''s Kim Jong Un), but still, it is very rare that we can get to see an insightful documentary under such an oppressive government again.<>For all it's faults, at least North Korea seem to know what they are doing.

There's no moaning or moping about, they do what is necessary to survive. Good for them<>In the interests of being ""fair"" and ""balanced"", the movie ends up being a piece of North Korean propaganda.  Never mind the fact that no questions were asked on any of the pressing issues regarding North Korea...death camps, famine, political prisoners, punishing three generations (slave labor in a concentration camp) for a political crime, nuclear arms testing, lack of basic necessities (like soap and electricity), inability for citizens to leave the country, etc., etc.  The main issue in this documentary is that North Korea is notorious for the level of control it exercises on its people and foreigners who come into their country.  If anyone watching this film thinks this is an accurate portrait of daily life North Korea, you have been fooled by the North Korean propaganda machine.  Its almost as if Dennis Rodman made the movie for his buddy Kim.  In any event, the movie has won many awards in NORTH KOREA...so that must say something.<>It would appear that a live-action adaptation of The Hunger Games came first, predating even the book!

And frightening.  Definitely worth it just to get a rare glimpse into the most elusive of countries.  Also, Mass Games are super-impressive.<>something that gets you thinking, and an interesting view of lives in a communist country.<>completely surreal and mind-blowing. it is so hard to tell how North Korean people feel behind those seemingly geniune smiles. how can they be truly happy? can anyone if they knew about the truth? about the concentration camps? do they not see how brainwashed they have become? or is it just an act for the camera? i sincerely wish it is in fact an act, only then there would be hope for a free nation.<>Finally an interesting, enlightening and a somewhat neutral documentary.

NOTES:

1   On November 22, 1963, a promotional commercial featuring Sandra Dee was aired on KLIF Radio in Dallas, Texas following one of the first reports concerning the shootings of President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally.

If you have time you should see it, though, for Robert Morley's amazingly underplayed loony. Her Ladyship noticed Jim Nabors's uncredited cameo, but I didn't recognize him.<>James Stewart is a hoot! Especially during the whole masquerade party and costume, as well as, in NOT being the famous, James Stewart.<>another tepid entry in stewart's late career pix.<>A frustrating seemingly going nowhere comedy about about an over protective father & his free wayward daughter.

Jimmy Stewart goes from articulate to draining rather quickly & the film just has no real life to it.

Sandra Dee is rather forgettable in her role & this film just fails to impress...the longest 100 min movie I have seen in a while.<>If anybody should play a befuddled father, it's Jimmy Stewart.  He is hilarious.<>Jimmy Stewart is the overprotective father you actually want, in this movie.<>Another great Stewart/Koster comedy from the 60's. Stewart gives the best performance in the film, and is very funny, as the harrassed, and concerned father of his daughter, played by Sandra Dee. It gets more and more entertaining as the story progresses, as Stewart gets in over his head with one bad situation after another. This is a lot of laughs, and it was amusing how the Stewart character kept getting bothered by people who thought he was actor James Stewart. This is a film that deserves a more proper release, than it has been given. I have to say, that this one is probably better than Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation. Well worth checking out.<>One of Jimmy's most Comedic roles.",Henry Koster,"Nov 13, 1963 original",,20th Century Fox,,,,

Symmetricities are everywhere, starting with that opening architectural showreel, which deliberately avoids perfect symmetricity...<>Their sincere expression of these thoughts rings true and melts away its artificiality in its presentation soon enough. This is the beauty of La Sapienza and Green films in general.<>It's a nice entry point into a peculiar cinematic universe, and those willing to open themselves to it will find a lot to enjoy.<>If architecture aspires to the condition of music, the acting in La Sapienza aspires to the condition of architecture. You will love the ending of this very original and elegant and arty work.<>This startling architectural juxtaposition feels like a wake-up call.<>While Green's film is dense with historical fact and theory, it's not averse to plumbing life's mysteries. Suffused with warmth, it expresses a potent admiration for human striving and accomplishment.<>The uncomplicated narrative resists stylization; Green's presentation turns everyone into mannequins, rendering their emotions theoretical. That may well be his point, but it didn't work for me.<>On the surface, writer-director Eugne Green's film ""La Sapienza"" is slow, strange and awkward - but stick with it and it may win you over.<>Layered with reels of swirling shots of Rome's most beautiful buildings -- all crucially shot from the ground upwards, staring at the heavens-- La Sapienza is visually stunning.<>The Sapience juxtaposes insights on how people are emotionally connected with ruminations on the buildings and spaces through which they move, in which they live and, in Alexandre's case, which they also create.<>If you can groove into this non-realistic mode, the film casts a spell.<>A beautiful space for people and light.<>This kind of formalism needs to do more than walk through classical wonders. It should want to create cinema that can stand near or beside them. This movie defensively consecrates what's already there. You don't need a film to do that.<>An exquisite rumination on life, love and art that tickles the heart and mind in equal measure.<>Green's richly textured, painterly images fuse with the story to evoke the essence of humane urbanity and the relationships that it fosters, whether educational, familial, or erotic.<>Green doesn't so much use his characters as mouthpieces as emotionally invest them in art, turning opinions into feelings.<>""La Sapienza"" strikes this reviewer as easily the most astonishing and important movie to emerge from France in quite some time.<>The movie is an unapologetically rarefied undertaking and at the same time a gracious and inviting film.<>Pretentious, stuffy and slow. There's some beautiful scenery here but oh, what you must put up with to earn it!<>While La Sapienza is unsatisfying as drama, it's frequently beautiful just as a tour through architecturally significant Italian buildings.","Moving at a leaden pace, over-intellectualized and stiff in style, La Sapienza recoils from the compelling story at its core--husband and wife each meet an unlikely younger friend and maybe refresh their own relationship as a result--and it strangles the life out of the character relationships, moving at a leaden pace for the first hour until it finally suggests a reason for this. I'm not against slow, considered films (I quite liked Museum Hours, for example), but this one didn't do it for me.<>Numerous ways this movie engaged me and kept me learning.  Love it.<>Com planos e ângulos bastante simétricos, o filme fala sobre um arquiteto ateu e que valoriza o caminho da razão. Até que ele e sua esposa encontram um jovem aspirante à arquitetura que mostra para ele um jeito mais emocional e espiritual de enxergar o mundo. 

O filme inteiro traça paralelos entre o sagrado e o racional, seja contando a história de dois arquitetos famosos ou colocando personagens com pensamentos diferentes em diálogos profundos.

O que pode ser desagradável é o fato de o garoto de 18 anos ter tanto conhecimento sobre a vida, mas se o espectador levar para o lado da metáfora, não terá problemas com isso.<>Visually, this is one of the most stunning and beautiful films of all time. Although the film is very light on plot, the film is full of intelligent, and interesting dialogue, and the film is, overall, one of the best films of 2015 so far.<>Pretentious, stiff, reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman films of the 1960s, but (fortunately) adding stunning scenery of Italian lakes and Roman churches. So setting/scenery: check. All but absent in the plot, character development, or meaning departments.<>This movie intertwines the inner lives of four intriguing individuals with an astonishing set of lessons in art, architecture and beauty. Most compelling!<>Another turgid film about a successful professional who has severe ennui. If it were not for the stunning cinematography of the Borromini chapels and glorious Musial performances, it would have been a complete waste of 1h 40m.<>A pretty, observational, and nebulously supernatural look at European architecture and it's effect on culture and humanity. While it's story is slight, it finds it's thematic density through it's philosophical musings, and character interactions. Eugène Green proves to also be a very skilled marksmen with his camera work, capturing human expression as vividly as he does architecture.<>I love foreign films but this one was so boring that I walked out after an hour and 15 minutes.  Unless you love Italian architecture avoid at all costs.<>Despite any number of professional accolades, Alexandre(Fabrizio Rongione), an architect, finds his marriage with Alienor(Christelle Prot Landman) in rocky shape.  So, they travel to a lake in Switzerland to spend some quality time together, trying to recapture some of the old magic.  What they find instead is siblings Goffredo(Ludovico Succio) and Lavinia(Arianna Nastro).  And then Alienor surprises her husband by volunteering to stay in town to look after the ailing Lavinia while Goffredo continues his architecture studies in Turin with Alexandre.

""La Sapienza"" gets off to a rough start, as the movie assumes that Alexandre's sour mood is solely from his atheism, not something less existential, like say, severe constipation.  Thankfully, the movie eventually recovers, allowing for an occasionally heady exploration of art, history, architecture, romance and most importantly sideburns.  At the same time, the tone tends towards the deep end of the pretentiousness spectrum, sometimes unnecessarily so.  And I'm still not exactly sure what this whole sapience thing was about but then I guess that's what Google is for.",,,,,,,,

The first is Yael Grobglas...

Not much substance is buried beneath the irritating style.<>The niftily claustrophobic use of actual Jerusalem locations offers a nice holiday from the more familiar backdrops favored by the POV genre.<>Yes, this is yet another found-footage horror film shot on a shoestring, but there's no need to despair since JeruZalem is a wildly entertaining, often unbearably intense and occasionally drawer-filling experience.<>There are moments in the picture that hint at greater things to come, and the helmers have potential as horror handlers, but ""Jeruzalem,"" at best, is sharp short film uncomfortably stretched out into a plodding feature.<>The movie's occasional stabs at political commentary never quite pay off. Nor can the writer-directors, brothers Yoav and Doron Paz, fully sustain the film's novelty into the second half, when the script reverts to timeless, tired monster-movie tropes.<>There's a definite fun factor to Jeruzalem that helps make it just entertaining enough.<>On the surface its story is slight - demonic horrors are unleashed and people run around trying to survive - but there's much more going on in a film which amply deserves the awards it has received.<>With their tale of petrified friends, governmental gods and roaming murder, Jeruzalem is a terrific and terrible vision of what, for all we know, may well be.<>A few sub-plots get lost... but this offers a satisfyingly large-scale demonic incursion as glimpsed from the streets.","one of the worse movies i ever saw<>This is not bad for a low budget indie horror movie.

😭✋Prepare of one hell of a ride!😭✋ 
This was an okay movie. The intro took 45 minutes and that was just too long for me. The first 30 minutes were good. I enjoyed it. But then I took 15 minutes extra and I just felt bored. Lucky, when the 45 minutes are over, it starts good! In my opinion was the ""we must go the gates"" scène, the best ""We have to get out of here"" scène ever. I thought that was the best part of the movie. Later in the movie, things became a little bit weird. The characters made so stupid choices that it wasn't even dumb anymore, but annoying. And because of that I laughed so hard. The CGI is actually the scariest thing of the movie. So bad! I couldn't stop laughing. And the acting... those actors needs to work on their acting again. The characters were not good. Stereo-types. But I wasn't bothered by that. The sex scène between Sarah and Kevin wasn't even special. The underground scène was actually not that great. The only thing that I liked at that scène, was that (...) killed (...) when (...) became a laughable CGI-thing. And the ending... I ain't gonna spoil it, but it was one of the most laughable endings I ever saw. Overall... JeruZalem is weird, dumb and bad. But because of these things it is still enjoyable. I say: watch it whit a group of friends and you will have a hell of a good time 🥲<>This movie had so much potential. I hope they do a better 2nd part because this movie could have been so much better.<>could not even finish the movie. I tried to give it a chance. The Character Sarah was too annoying for my taste. The line when she was asked what she believed and she stated she is old school she believes in science while she is in Jerusalem which I would think would be more old school than believing in science, had me rolling my eyes.<>The only thing I like about the movie is that it is set in Jerusalem. Rarely do I see movies set in these place.
It's just really stupid how entitled the American women are in the movie especially how Sarah criticised the soldiers for leaving her in the asylum. In the first place, the soldier clearly stated that they're just going in there for three minutes then they're leaving. So after reuniting with the rest of the group after finding Kevin, Sarah slaps one of the soldiers for leaving her. As if she's the one giving them orders. I just hate how mediocre the soldiers are portrayed in the movie.
I scare easily and cover my eyes when I'm watching scary films but this film just bored me to death.
The first part of the movie was great but died down until the end.<>Set in Jerusalem, which is the best part.  Some of the acting is marginal and the central story is pedestrian and clichéd.  The most interesting parts are what we get the least of.<>Unwatchable

They failed on both counts.  Gobs of lifeless nudity can't balance out the intensely bad acting, aggravating characters, and crappy music.  Acting titan Julie Cialini has only one job: stand around naked looking pretty.  She can't even get that right.  She looks lost and more than a little confused without a stripper pole to guide her.  It's that kind of movie.  There are some interesting ideas squandered on a bad cast and script.    I'm a sucker for shape changer films, but this one is just a channel changer.

Wolfhound is a throwback to the captivating fantasy films of the 1980?s, such as Beastmaster and Conan the Barbarian. They share similar character types and simple plots of good versus evil.
This type of film is like an extended, larger-than-life fairy tale ? it requires a suspension of belief and a desire to enjoy.

Dustin Hoffman is Brilliant as Willy Loman, and John Malkovich likewise as Biff. Rest of the cast is great as well. Beautiful poignant story that really makes you think. Excellent production.<>I remember reading the book this film is adapted from, when I was in secondary school, although I didn't remember too many of the details but I knew it was about a travelling man in New York, who talked about Yonkers a lot and was going through a mid life crisis of sorts. I felt Dustin Hoffman was a good choice of actor for the main character - he does well playing the main character, the thoughtful yet curmudgeonly man (Willy Loman). Willy's vocalised constant stream of thoughts was something I could relate to myself, being a bit of a constant thinker myself. This is a slow paced film but its reasonably good I thought as a character focussed drama. The setting the film is mostly in, i.e. the family house (mostly), is quite sparse and I felt it had the look of a theatrical production, stage show/play perhaps. I believe its a made-for-TV film, though I got it on DVD via a newspaper giveaway. Its pretty clear that the budget for this title was somewhat low and if your keen on action packed type films then obviously this won't be for you but if your a fan of the book, then you'll likely find this enjoyable enough (well, ok such a story isn't entirely enjoyable as such but you know what I mean, a decent film version) but I wouldn't say its an especially memorable film as such. I thought it was decently ok, a thoughtful watch but not entirely great as a film per se, so I wouldn't give it more than 6 out of 10 I suppose. I'd have liked there to be less of the wistful music played in the background, which was distracting at times, a bit too forcedly sentimental. 

I did feel that the wife, Linda Loman (played by Kate Reid), put in a decent performance too, which certainly helps. If your not aware of the story, I'd say thematically it deals with pride, loss of identity and parental disappointment and expectations, among other things. Its a somewhat sad and philosophical film which is, as I say, reasonably good in terms of being a heavily dialogue driven character drama but if your not esp. keen on that, then it may be a bit bland for your tastes but if this appeals, then I'd cautiously recommend it, yes.<>Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as Willy Loman, and really, every role is played superbly.  Critics are divided on their interpretation of this classic, but they aren't divided in recognizing that it is a classic.  How could they?  The Pulitzer Prize winning play has been performed worldwide to great acclaim.  It's taught in schools.  Yet, it is an enigmatic today as it ever was.<>This is more a critique of Arthur Miller than the great performances in this film, but I f'ing hate this play, teleplay, screenplay...Arthur Miller's ""All My Sons"" practically came true, and I still hold all his work against him like he's some kind of mean and nasty Nostradamus. 

Arthur and I have an ongoing imaginary dialogue about him not being able to write his actors offstage without them killing themselves, and it always winds up with me strangling him which is not good for any imaginary play. It is all very depressing, and no actor should be tortured with this in theatre or reality. This is a big snoozer-roonie-sad-and-loonie for audiences, and that's a very official literary term (just ask Arthur).<>Death of a Salesman is a play and a movie that is directed by Volker Schlondorff and written by Arthur Miller. The main character isn't Willy Loman but his dream. The author's most famous drama is focused on the dream of an ordinary man who finds a cruel reality.

The plot describes a broken salesman Willy Loman who suffers from delusions because of his work. He isn't able to make a difference between reality and his memories. His miserable life gets worse thanks to his older son and his boss. Therefore, at the end of the play he decides to commit suicide to help his family.

Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman is a perfect example of a broken person's life. Dustin Hoffman doesn't use exaggerated gestures but believable. I can say the same about Kate Reid in the role of Willy's wife Linda and two young actors John Malkovich and Stephen Lang who play the sons Biff and Happy. 

Volker Schlondorff doesn't perform as a director. He focuses on dialogues and wants to show the dominance of the actors which I find very good and interesting. 

The movie sticks with the original script pretty well, but there are quite some differences in the movie. One of the differences is that Willy in the original script says ""I'm fat. I'm very --- foolish to look at, Linda."" and ""I heard him say something about --- walrus.""  but in the movie instead of I'm fat he says I'm short because the actor isn't really fat and the insult walrus  was changed to shrimp because it wouldn't  fit for him.

The movie Death of a Salesman 1985 is reviewed quite positively. The positive reviews are: the setting, very good tense atmosphere and performance of the actors. The negative reviews are: the movie is very long, a terrible adaptation and poor lighting. 

At the beginning we can find this movie uninteresting but as the story goes by it is pretty good. Audience can appreciate good performances by the actors.<>I can't say I'm a movie geek. Since, I  go to the cinema once a month or whenever a really great movie I've been waiting for is in display. I don't have enough time. I am always in a rush. But Occasionally, I watch videos or movies required in class, or some I plan to watch on my little free time. I would like to present for your enjoyment the film ""Death of a Salesman""
It's a drama. Dustin Hoffman is starring in it as (Willy Loman).In Adittion to: John Malkovich as (Biff Loman),Kate Reid as (Linda Loman), Stephen Lang as (Happy Loman), Charles Durning as (Charley), Louis Zorich as (Ben Loman) and Jon Polito as (Howard).  For one thing, it last 2hours and 16 minutes. It is set in Broklyn in the lates 1940s it takes place mostly at Willy Loman's House. 
The main characters are:  Willy Loman (An aging salesman.

Like,Tony Award Author(Arthur Miller), New York Drama Critics'(Circle Best Play),Drama Desk Award Outstanding Revival,Drama Desk Award Outstanding Actor in a Play(Dustin Hoffman),Drama Desk Award Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play(John Malkovich),Tony Award for Best Reproduction. 
	Mostly the vast majority of the critics were fascinated by the movie.For Instance, From Wall Street Journal: ""A Smile, a Shoeshine and a Saint""(Terry Teachout), New York Times: ""American Dreamer, Ambushed by the Territory"" (Ben Brantley) New Yorker:""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Mediocrity""(Giles Harvey) 
I'm surprised on how much I enjoyed the movie, after first 20 minutes it's an attention grabber. It reminds me of some assigned courses movie I enjoyed so much they become my all time favorites. One can't help but to feel sympathy for the poor devil that is Willy Loman.<>""Death of a Salesman"" by Arthur Miller is the classic American tragedy everyone should watch because of its 1)moral, 2)setting and 3)actors interpretation of the characters. ""Death of a Salesman,"" tells the story of Willy Loman a short, mediocre, 63-year-old man in pursuit of holding on to the little dignity he has left in the always changing society he lives in. Willy Loman is a salesman who is a fierce believer of ""The American Dream"" and how being liked and having money are the most memorable characteristics a man could have. I personally found the movie a bit slow on the storytelling but it fitted how Willy Loman's character was slowly spiraling into dementia because of his greed. 
The movie gives us a 1)lesson on how false pride can not just corrupt our mind but also our family. For instance, Willy Loman's son Biff, a 34-year-old man, who could never take responsibility for himself because his father always falsy resolved his problems. On the other hand, we also get 1)enlightenment of how the material things cannot bring any true happiness to a person. For example, Willy Loman's younger son Happy Loman, a 32-year-old man, had success in the professional aspect but could never be happy instead he turned to a womanizer who waits for the death of his boss. Even though, Willy Loman cannot shake the responsibility of his actions his wife Linda Loman, whom he cheated too, is determined to protect him from himself. Bring on the tragedy genre Arthur Miller gave us the end of Willy Loman in a transcendental way. Throughout the movie we see Willy Loman falling apart and turn into a spiral of lies but at the moment when Bernard his geeky neighbor son of Charlie his successful neighbor became a lawyer, he faces reality and questions what he did wrong. But it's not till the very end when Biff Loman loses his temper at him he realizes the truth of what a lie he has lived. In this manner, Willy commits suicide and leaves the earth with the same things he came to it, nothing. 
Also, the 2)surroundings of the story are perfect and give the audience the feel of the troubles this family has gone through. The 2)scenery takes place in the late 1940s in a post World War II Brooklyn in New York. The 2)atmosphere of the movie is washed up shadowed taking place in Willy Loman's head, house, yard and in Manhattan. The movie also has an exceptional principal cast with Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman, John Malkovich as Biff Loman, Stephe Lang as Happy Loman and Kate Reid as Linda Loman. It also has a wonderful supporting cast with Charles Durning as Charley and David S Chandler as Bernard. Dustin Hoffman brought an impeccable 3)portrayal of the short Willy Loman with his undying "" American dream"". Also, his 3)performance marks the audience with a sense of pity and anger towards Willy Loman that is impossible to shake off. For this and much more ""Death of a Salesman"" it's worth 135 minutes of your time.<>In the movie The death of a salesman by Arthur Miller and directed by Volker Schlondorff, social criticism and hypermasculinity are presented. The actors Dustin Hoffman, Kate Reid, John Malkovich and Stephen Long did a fantastic job on portraying their characterï¿ 1/2(TM)s personalities. This dramatic movie lasts about two hours and fifteen minutes and takes place in New York. The main characters are Willie Lowman, Linda Lowman, Billy Lowman and Happy Lowman. They are a somewhat dysfunctional family mainly because of  the salesman Willie Lowman who is the father of the household. The movie revolves around his mental health, social abilities, ambitions and how these affect everyone in his vicinity. The film concludes with his death as foreshadowed in the title. This drama has received a Pulitzer Prize under the category of  Drama and a Tony Award for Best Play. After reading the script and watching the movie I observed how much society can pressure and damage an individual while trying to succeed and fit in. The american dream is not an easy goal to achieve and it can break families forever just like what happened with the Lowman family. In addition, the movie also portrays a patriarchal society where the man is the only one with the right to speak and give an opinion.<>Laura Rodriguez

This film tells the story tells of the Loman family , an American, yet troubled family based in New York City in the 1940s. The father, Willy Loman is a very tired elderly salesman, who is obsessed with achieving the American Dream.He is also convinced that being popular will help you succeed in life. Throughout the film we are shown important characters like: Biff, Happy,Linda etc. This movie shows the struggle this family is going through and how it affects his family and those around him. It also touches sensitive topics such as suicide, depression, false expectations and many more. Although the movie can feel a bit long and it tends to get boring at times, the acting was very good. The setting of the film was very accurate to the setting described in the play although it did look cheap at times. This film portrays very well the struggles of the American Dream which are still very present to this day. To make this movie enjoyable for audiences, they should make a newer version of the movie that in result will make the movie get more recognition.<>As a movie enthusiast, I comprehend the fact that achieving the âperfect filmâ? is somewhat an impossible task to accomplish, mainly because movies are a highly subjective form of art that depends on the personâ(TM)s taste level. In this case, the 1985 TV production of Death of a Salesman written by Arthur Miller and directed by Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff; under a relatively low-budget rendition of the acclaimed play, it manages to make ambitious decisions. At the same time, as a screen-production, the film has its setbacks in different areas. For one thing, it was really creative to use the cinematography to accentuate how stuck the Loman family was under the promises of the American Dream, but since most of the movie is shot in this type of framing it could sometimes read through as uninspired and as a viewer it would become rather boresome and uncomfortable. On the other hand, in terms of the setting, the feeling of watching a play on screen was executed marvelously. However, this idea doesnâ(TM)t translate equally during a film and as a result, it never feels like we are immersed in the world of Brooklyn in the late 1940s, instead it felt like watching independent sets that didnâ(TM)t connect with each other. Likewise, another doubtful aspect of the film would be its lumpy sound quality, since some scenes were too low to the point that the characters were unintelligible and other scenes were too loud to the point that Willy Lomanâ(TM)s voice became aggravating from time to time. Another component from the film was the acting from fellow co-stars like John Malkovich as Biff Loman and Kate Reid as Linda Loman with terrific performances by both actors. Nonetheless, Dustin Hoffmanâ(TM)s portrayal of the tragic protagonist Willy Loman was very exceptional to say the least, although I donâ(TM)t think Hoffman differentiated acting in theater from acting on camera since most of the time he was a bit overbearing to the extent that it cast a shadow over the other characters performances. In addition, his portrayal wasnâ(TM)t as layered as one expected and the only moments where he stood out the most was when he talked and murmured to himself. Overall this film is very impressive since most of the weight of it was supported by the script and the actorâ(TM)s charisma though the direction and production were quite ambiguous.",,,,,TVPG,,Stereo,

There has rarely been a better film made, ever","The direction of this film is somewhat unique. The film consists of different chapters of the lead character’s life that lead him into disarray and become suicidal. <>I recently saw Chang-dong Lee's ""Beoning"" - a remarkable film. I have also seen ""Milyang"" that's a solid piece and I have heard great things about ""Oasiseu"". I believe this is one of his lesser known films, even if the man only have done six.

A man kills himself. This is one of the first things that happen here. Then we see his life in a reverse linear narrative, divided into five pieces. Some stories are building on others, many of them of the first clip. We watch his growing struggles in a reverse order and it's a original and cool way of presentation. 

It's a bit long and a bit flat at times, even if the violence are both rather raw and often appearing. The subtitles seem very weak and that might have killed a fair bit of this film. The shooting is nice and I like the train shots that we get between stories. OK acting and overall a cool production with some hights when it comes to scenes.
OK film, but nothing more.
 
6 out of 10 trains.<>An established Korean novelist Lee Chang-dong came to the world of filmmaking quite late surprisingly shifting his career from writing plays and fiction. He released his debut film Green Fish in 1997 when he was 43 years old. This film has received wide acclaim and granted Lee Chang-dong a reputation of new influential Korean director. Peppermint Candy (2000) became the second feature-length film of Lee Chang-dong.

A piercing tragedy in Peppermint Candy starts with the protagonist Yong-ho (portrayed by Sol Kyung-gu) committing suicide. The rest of the story is told in a reverse chronology disclosing the events of the character's past leading him to climb up the track and face the train in his suicide. The train track appears every time after new flashback of Yong-ho illustrating his way back in time. In his last moments of life, he couldn't stand it anymore. His traumatized mind was reluctant to deal with either present or future, as Yong-ho was now completely devastated. He gets a final release looking into the past as the train goes back in time, in order to revive the background of this emotional breakdown.

The story of Yong-ho is told in connection with two main characters of his life. Sun-im (Moon So-ri) is the first love of Yong-ho he met 30 years ago. They met during a college trip, and she gave him a peppermint candy he really liked. She symbolizes the character's innocence and pure dreams of having a good future, becoming a photographer, loving a woman. Sun-im enters comatose in the first flashback prior to Yong-ho's suicide. Her last wish was to see him and to hand him a photo camera she has bought him many years ago. Encounter with Sun-im becomes the last drop in Yong-ho's breakdown. But in the other flashbacks, we see how their relationships developed, and how he has lost an emotional link with Sun-im and his innocence she symbolized.

The second character employed to depict the character's tragedy is his wife Hong-ja (Kim Yeon-jin). In flashbacks, we see their marriage not working, and he never used to love Hong-ja or care about her. A flashback shows the time they met when Yong-ho's personality was already corrupted. Many years back he was pulling Hong-ja in front of loving Sun-im just to show the first love he has changed, and there is no way to be together. He marries Hong-ja just for the sake of marrying someone. It comes as no surprise, he ruins the life of Hong-ja traumatizing Sun-im earlier and himself.

Flashbacks connect the tragedy and breakdown of Yong-ho with political events and social problems of South Korea. He's got drafted to the army in 1980 to perform mandatory military services for several years. Before that, he was just a teenager who had no intent to fight. He met Sun-im, and they fell in love. She's been sending him the peppermint candies to the military parts for months while he was dreaming to reunite with his love. However, it was just a dream. The army appeared to be very cruel, and Yong-ho was treated awfully there. Moreover, his unit was sent to quell The Gwangju Uprising in 1980. This day resulted in massacre and Yong-ho accidentally shot the innocent young girl dead. The country and military service have traumatized him this day giving a strat to the destruction of his personality.

Later, we see Yong-ho becoming a police officer. He has a short temper, we see his personality becoming more violent as he tortures the student in the police office. He is not able to get over that day he killed a girl, and now he plots revenge to the world with his cruel methods of work. As time goes by, he becomes even more violent. He refuses to be kind and loving with Sun-im when they meet. Later, he would make one shy attempt to reunite with her, but it won't work. The next time he meets her is the time a few days prior to his own death. He brings peppermint candies to the hospital and talks to Sun-im who is unconscious in a coma. Few hours later, in anger, he sells the camera she left him. She has bought this camera many years ago knowing he wanted to be a photographer, but he refused to take it. Now he destroys from this camera the tape as he wants to have no memories of the past. He cannot get back his innocence as he can't be with Sun-im anymore.

The photo camera, peppermint candies and train appear as the symbols of the protagonist's past several times. These symbols are very simple, as well as the whole story. Yet this clarity doesn't make it boring. The director shows this tragedy in a very simple way, but the film is very thought-provoking and deep. Lee Chang-dong demonstrates in this film both social issues of his country and violent political events of the Korean history. We see how dangerous and harmful these things could be on an example of Yong-ho. The breakdown has started when he simply went to the army, but then he would kill a girl, loose his love, torture people, destroy the life of his wife, scammed by the business partner. In the end of this tragedy, he would have nothing left but the memories of the photo camera and peppermint candy. The traumatic events of his past embed the character in the present he is not able to deal with.<>This understated film has a epic feel to it as we try to understand the motives of  the film's main character Kim and why he commits suicide. This is a unique and heartbreaking film that slowly unravels the reasoning behind Kim's bitter and brutal nature. I did not like Kim throughout the film, which would usually put someone off but Chang-Dong slowly lays out all of the horrors he's seen and has had to partake in which forces you to feel some level of empathy for a horrible man. A near masterpiece.<>Peppermint Candy is a compelling piece of cinema who uses its main characters tragic story arc as an analogy for the political climate in South Korea from 1979 to 1999.<>Peppermint Candy begins in 1999 during a class reunion. Yong-ho acts strangely around fellow classmates and then begins to behave more erratically before running to nearby train tracks where he kills himself by standing in front of a train. From then on, the film takes you back on the last twenty years of his life and what led to that point. It's not only an odyssey for the main character, but also a reflection of the tumultuous history of South Korea. It's a film that explores not only the sad parts of his life, but also a reflection of his younger hopeful self and his future. It's a difficult and painful exploration into his tragic life that hits hard. Like other films from director, Lee Chang-dong, the viewer is never given easy answers and the characters are never given an easy route through their problems. You feel Yong-ho's burdens and troubles as they slowly destroy him over the years. Peppermint Candy is a tragically underrated film that I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good drama. It won't be an easy viewing, but it's one of those dramas that stays with you long afterward.<>Very great movie. A bit too long, at 2 and a half hours. But, it is simply a biographical decline of one man, who is changed from innocence. It is a fantastic movie. Good acting ad plot.<>Rightly considered one of the best films of the decade in Korea, this is story telling at its finest, spanning twenty years, and told in reverse direction, the tale of a doomed man in the backdrop of a nation in turmoil.<>Flasback masa lalu yang tak terlupakan...<>The problem is the lack of a plot.

The characters form an interesting unit.  Jim Belushi is pretty good as the rag-tag leader.  But it falls apart on the battle scenes and completely lacks a reason for the battle.  The attacking Germans look like a line of idiots and when they get shot they flail about in ancient Hollywood fashion.  Just a dreadful ending, spoiling a perfectly good set up.<>Not even close to as good as the original.<>This remake is better than I expected....it sticks pretty close to the original but does change a few details here and there.... Belushi is surprisingly effective in the Bogart role and  the rest of the cast perform well.... it's no substitute for the original but it is an interesting alternative take on the story..<>Remake of the 1943 Bogart film which I haven't seen so I can't compare, but believe it or not its actually a really decent film that boasts some great performances, great location work and a nice overall look of realism with uniforms, weapons and vehicles.

Belushi takes the lead as the American Sgt. 'Joe Gunn' (nice butch name there) and really does well with his role, he's strong decisive and all American as it should be god damn it. He is accompanied by a decent assortment of character actors portraying a selection of allied soldiers from various countries including France, England, Australia and Sudan. Each of the soldiers also come from different regions in each country eg. Yorkshire and London in England.

The film is your classic gun-ho, manly, machine gun totting heroism which could easily be a propaganda tool if you think about it, all the allied soldiers are salt of earth stand up blokes who think nothing of fighting till the bitter end, standing alongside their Sgt.

Yes its a bit overblown and not too realistic as this small bunch of gruff fellas take on a whole German battalion in the middle of the Sahara (within an ancient ruin) simply to halt their progress because the Germans think there is a water filled well there. But the simplistic plot and abundant all American stars n stripes mixed with various nationalities and their own patriotic views as they band together to stop the Nazi war machine is well presented with some exciting boys own type action sequences that would make 'Indy' proud.

With the odds stacked against them I think you can guess this small band of brothers fate, unless you've seen the Bogart version then you already know hehe but do you really think Uncle Sam's boys would fail to stop the Germans here?<>I still remember when I found this film back in the 90s on the shelves of the Video renting shop by coincidence and was interested to watch it. The movie was interesting but with a slightly slow tempo. Some actors had to do more effort acting but overall it was good.

When watching I kept thinking it was like a 90s movie in the dated style of a 50s one, and just now I've noticed it is a remake of a '43 Humphrey Bogart film - which sorta explains this remake's need to propagandise the UN into the good guys and have the Nazis as a faceless wall of evil. Everything is played very straight-faced, but the cast is pretty game, and the whole endeavour is surprisingly held together by Belushi - not your typical 90s action hero - but he pulls of the Bogie role pretty well, considering I watched this film after changing the channel immediately after ""According to Jim"".<>Pretty sad that most of them had to die at the end after all that character development. The battles were pretty good and so were the humoristic parts. Yea, it's good as a TV movie.<>Review will be written when/if re-watched (Probability: Zero).

Narrated in an elaborately ornamented way and fantastically acted.<>A celebration of life that acknowledges how family leads to both great love and anguish, yet out of that comes a willingness to endure and overcome.<>This is a fleet, gentle movie, and I enjoyed it...<>The film is an ode to love, in all its messiness and bliss.<>It gave the Hindi film industry an alternative way of portraying the Big Fat Indian Wedding, and all its non-stop accompanying tamasha....<>Nair confronts cultural conflict and taboos many times, which are explicitly shown in shockingly frank and revealing ways.<>This drama by Mira Nair has been hailed as a feel-good spree, but it's better than that-a barely stable compound of the wounding, the confusing, and the appealing.<>There is the madness of a family wedding, there's a disturbing secret and there is also a snapshot of India at that moment in time. This is a film that doesn't date.<>Deliriously joyous.<>Mira Nair's most colorful and most fully realized film<>Not content to merely direct traffic of intersecting characters, Mira Nair never lets the scurrying ensemble lag or their stories flag. ""Monsoon Wedding"" is one of the most culturally savory, joyously exotic comedies since ""Strictly Ballroom.""<>Much of the movie's incidental fun comes from acute little observations and clever set-pieces.<>A late radical shift in tone, from jittery exuberance to ruinous alienation, strikes an impressive contemporary note amid all the obeisance to custom.<>... among the most universal of films<>A big, galloping party movie in which the party in question is a clear metaphor for the world.<>Nair's stereotype-shattering movie -- like the polymorphous culture it illuminates -- borrows from Bollywood, Hollywood and cinema verite, and comes up with something exuberantly its own.<>Splashy, noisy and downright fun.","Colorful drama and comedy. Stand out performance by Vijay Raaj as decorator.<>This film seemed a little dull at the start but I enjoyed the end and some of the dance scenes. Its more understated than most typical Bollywood films, with some nice characters. I can't say I fully followed all the plots but I enjoyed it enough to say its an ok film. I wouldn't expressly recommend it as such, no.<>I was pretty underwhelmed by this one, solely because I took the title too literally. I kept hoping and expecting their house to be blown away by a gigantic storm at any moment and for them to have the wedding in like a storm shelter or on a boat or something. Instead nothing really went wrong the entire movie, they prepared for the weather (which ended up just being some rain, perhaps the most disappointing monsoon in the history of cinema) and the actions that could've derailed the plot laid out at the start of the movie ultimately didn't at all. They did a good job of capturing chaos in a way that didn't feel messy or breathless and the performances were good, but I thought the plot itself was a little mundane with the tired trope of cold feet before a wedding coupled with excisable family drama. Mira is clearly a competent director and I look forward to seeing a movie of hers where the plot is more compelling!<>A mixed bag. Somewhat enjoyable but unoriginal in many ways and definitely not a comedy. It provides a good representation of the differences between India and the US through things like the costumes, singing/dancing, and colours. However, the plot was riddled with silly subplots for drama, from an affair to sexual abuse from a paedophile, the boy perhaps being gay, a romance between the maid and wedding decorator, and a romance between the Australian idiot and the woman with the tattoo. The affair was never properly explained, the wedding decorator didn't even come across as a good guy to the maid, so it makes little sense how they got together, the sexual abuse and concerns about it repeating were kept quiet as long as possible, and there was minimal focus on the actual wedding. Whilst there was a good mix of characters, some side characters got more attention than the 'main' character. This, the subplots, and all the singing/dancing meant the pacing was a bit rough. However, the acting was decent, the sets/props/costumes were well done and believable, the cinematography and visual effects were fine, and the soundtrack fit.<>First 75% of Monsoon Wedding: Ha ha, the conservative father is quarreling with his son because he has a love for baking and dance!
Last 25% of Monsoon Wedding: Okay, so the pedophile joke was not just a bit of dark humor...

The best way to describe this film is that it somehow combines an Indian take on a family wedding melodrama (in all its silliness, exasperation, and fun) with Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration. There are multiple serious subplots that are contrasted against the backdrop of a brightly colored celebration, but they come, they go, and the next scene is a father fretting over expenses; it's very Bollywood in that manner, the neatly tied up conclusions. The more somber moments are crafted with the intent to shine a light on the changing nature of Indian society, but they are essentially just that, moments; one second the bride is engaging in an affair with an ex that immediately disappears, then has an immediate crisis of consciousness before coming clean, sparking a row over honesty, fidelity, and tradition ... before it is resolved a few minutes later. The film's darkest territory, where (spoiler) it turns out that the family head is not only attempting to sexually assault his niece but has a historical pattern of sexual abuse that has been glossed over, is rectified by the father figure bravely ... asking him to leave. This all happens in about 15 minutes. It's a surprisingly sombre twist and has commentary about the dangerous level of control in India's historically patriarchal society, but the subplot comes and goes shockingly fast compared to the weight of the boom it lowers. 

Indian films are notorious for tone shifts and stories that feel like pastiches, and while many seem to navigate these balancing acts between exuberant comedy and poignant drama surprisingly well, this doesn't seem to be one of them. (2.5/5)<>1001 movies to see before you die.  This was much better than what I had expected from Bollywood.  This was a complicated plot about an Indian wedding and the complications that come with expectations and family.  It was well made and compelling.  It was on youtube.<>Color, music, even a dance in this serious comedy. Breathtaking street scenes of Delhi, great cast too. Mira Nair is one of the best at turning social values inside out. And, it hasn't aged a bit.<>There wasn't enough here to keep me engaged.<>Lovely, colorful, melodious love stories, and for me they all have the same weight in the movie, and that is why is such a nice work: the balance of things.

The 7 minute one shot ending is worthy of Antonioni comparison.<>Violet is a moving film but may not be for everyone as it is slow, moody, and depressing.<>To capture the confused numbness that can envelop someone in the wake of a loss is an achievement. To capture it in a profoundly visual way is challenging. To do this in your first feature-length film - as Bas Devos has done with VIOLET - is remarkable.<>Each shot could stand out on its own as a striking short, but together they can have a surprisingly overwhelming effect.<>Violet is an atmospheric drama that relies on its visuals to get the audience into the headspace of the main character. It is an arresting and intense watch that is wholly worth the experience.<>I'm not sure [Bas] Devos's avant garde style suits the slight story, but the film grew on me after awhile because of some especially otherworldly scenes.<>Violet is like looking at a sequence of mounted photos. You may well find its beauty if you can hold the film's gaze, but the viewer's one-way relationship to this meditation on grief is so unchanging it'd take a monk to appreciate it.<>I wound up admiring the movie for its ambition while unsatisfied with its achievement.<>Van Sant's influence clearly looms large, but Violet acts as more than its own artistic statement.<>Violet is a terrific first feature from an assured, confident talent.<>Despite a studied sense of detachment throughout, Devos' feature-length debut is a film of subtle power.<>The film asks us to grapple with what we don't know, to the degree our patience allows. But there is so much splendor here that you may not mind the emptiness.<>As a screenwriter - for this picture at least - Devos puts too much stock in his visual style to carry the meaning of a thinly plotted, snail-paced slice-of-life.<>While Devos gets a little too wrapped up in his process, trying to remain elusive, he certainly has a vision for the endeavor that braids art with ache, looking to make sense of personal loss.<>The final image, an 8-minute sequence shot, is a wonder to behold and ends the film on a perfect and perfectly poetic note.<>Intensely stylized, highly original and utterly mesmerizing.<>This is an exquisitely shot suburban tale of trauma, stretching the ""show-don't-tell"" golden rule of filmmaking to the furthest reaches.<>Violet is deft and rigorous, oblique to the point of inscrutability.<>It bores into the mourning process and its piquant combination of emotional numbness and sensory vulnerability, rigorously avoiding finding an easy way out of this quagmire.<>It's formally engaging, particularly in its use of sound (and silence), but it's also understated to the point of being comatose.","While the art work is amazing, the storyline, the screenplay, the poetic dialogues-- even if it gets to the point it becomes unecessary and rhetoric, i'll.give it that however, the character development for Violet has been awfully 'obliviated' and it creates a huge impact to the rest of the plot. There will be unecessary and uninteresting parts in the whole season that makes it less appreciated and does.not let the characters respond naturally in a situation accordingly which why the deama always occur like every 5 second of melancholia and in theory while the artwork is amazingly detailed is because it gives time to stall viewers on whats really happening; each episodes are supposed to make you cry according to the plot but it doesn't work. The dramatic scenes doesn't feel natural it feels unecessary and forced. It makes Violet a walking Clichï¿ 1/2 (C). This is an adaptation of light novel for teenagers however the depiction of the animation is far fetch from the novel itself.<>Title: Exaggerates in trying to be different, thereby neglecting the dramatics of the underlying plot. Too much focus on vi­suals and too little time for dialog to enlighten us about the protagonists

   I saw the Belgian premiere at the Film Fest Gent 2014, in a venue with 360 seats fully booked. I consider myself an experienced visitor of film festivals, and hence used to experimental and unusual creative products. But still, though something happens all the time, I was wondering all the time what this film was all about and whether it was go­ing anywhere. While being a certified nerd who does not understand things like atmosphere, this film conveys nothing for me to digest or to take away. Yet I was not bored: I got the inclination to consult may watch not until after a full hour, merely to verify whether I wasn't running late for the next movie on my schedule (we started a bit late while the projection failed in the beginning).

   Notwithstanding a few positive remarks I've added to below paragraphs, I can say upfront that this seems (again) a typi­cal case where the format takes over and the contents suffers. It certainly is deeply tragic what happens as aftermath following the stabbing of a friend, combined with a feeling of failure in at least attempting to prevent it, but the story scarcely touches the dramatics of the subject at hand. Only a few scenes zoom in on the event itself and its close protago­nists. For example when the victim's parents are a bit embarrassed not knowing what to do with the package of blood stained clothes they received from the police. A second example is when Jesse is declared a coward and deemed not welcome anymore in his peer group. Alas, such sparse moments with a useful dialog that enlighten how our main characters feel, pass by too quickly and should have deserved more attention. Intentionally remote scenes, visually and dramatically, make up most of the running time, leaving us on a figurative distance from the protagonists.

   Maybe intended as a side issue, or just sheer luck to have them in this film, the gang of BMX riders is beautiful to watch in action. Even when just doing ""a brief round"" in the neighborhood, they are constantly trying tricks with their bikes. Just showing off, or constantly chasing perfection?? There are some extended field scenes where obstacles in na­ture are used to create spectacular jumps, watched by the camera from a safe distance. Dialog is mostly absent in these scenes, as could be expected. It did not bother me here, contrary to many other scenes where dialogs are dearly missed.

   Some scenes may be construed as being a nice original find (no more, no less) to deviate from the standard ways of filming. The best example lies in the opening scenes, where one initially thinks that something is wrong with the projec­tion. It takes a while before we find ourselves watching a set of surveillance monitors, overseeing a nearly empty shop­ping center. This drags on for some time, while nothing much seems to happen, other than the apparently bored security guard leaving his post for a piss or some coffee. We don't see the guard directly, only his reflection on the monitor screens. His departure clears up our indirect vision on the street, and transfers our focus to what happens there. Still not much, at first. Some adolescent boys seems to circle around each other, ending in a brief struggle and a sudden depar­ture of two of them. Obviously, we observed a fatal encounter, as we suddenly enter the scene where we see one lying on the street, and his friend calling on him to respond. We are left on our own devices to infer what actually happened.

   I added a lot of details in above paragraph, merely to illustrate my overall impression of this film. Many similar distantly observing scenes are exactly like this. So you know what to expect when deciding to go and see this movie. While ap­plauded by professional critics, as well as the international youth jury 2014 of the Berlinale film festival, it does not con­nect with an average viewer like myself. It may serve its purpose in bringing novel ideas to colleague film makers, but it certainly misses its primary purpose to attract a layman's audience. Also, it will fail to impress the typical arthouse fan (if such a beast exists) by exaggerating its attempts to be different. I have absolutely no sympathy for works of art like these, as seeming to have an existence purely for the inner crowd. It could have been made much more digestible by cutting some of the scenes that drag on far too long, and adding some extra dialogs to bring us closer to the protagonists and what does them tick. I might have myself considered warned beforehand, while observing that many reviews talk about the unusual film formats (nearly rectangular some of the time, wide screen at other times), the contrasting effects (sharp versus soft focus, loud versus soft sounds, distant versus close), and much more of such meta-talk.

   All in all, I could not do anything else that giving the lowest score for the audience award when leaving the theater. But finally, I still want to conclude with a positive remark, about a for-once successful attempt to be different. The final credits don't show the usual loooong list of contributors and participants, ranging from important to very unimportant, but this time we get an unordered list of names on the screen that does not change for some time. It suggests that every contri­bution to this film, be it large or small, was important for the final product. Very true, and it reminds us that not only the star roles can make or break a film, but also the 3rd assistant lighting boy has an effect.<>One of the best films I have seen in 2014. An incredibly visual and aural work that brings to mind Tarkovsky and Haneke and proof that cinema, as in entity in itself, can still offer up an experience that is completely unique even in the age of HBO, and on a minuscule budget.",,"May 12, 2017 limited",,Ryan Bruce Levey Film Distribution and PR Services,,,,

The casting was excellent.  The emotions of the people in the story feel believable.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  The cinematography is exceptional.  I don't imagine this movie could be made today because they chopped down tons of real trees to make it, but this is part of what makes the story so believable.  The scenery and landscapes are beautiful.  Without spoiling it, there's some noteworthy tragedy that really brings the movie home.  Well done.<>Henry Fonda is the head of a headstrong lumbering family in Oregon.  They refuse to join a strike against a lumber company which angers the townsfolk.  Paul Newman is the rebellious son who doesn't care how many feathers get ruffled.  It's a tough movie since none of the characters are particularly sympathetic.  Each can be very difficult.  The tragic moments that occur are harsh, unexpected, and nail biting.  It shows the dangers of this type of occupation and thee type of people who excel in it.  Richard Jaekel was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.<>ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES TO UNDERSTAND WAHT REAL RURAL AMERICA IS.<>Sometimes a Great Notion is a strange duck of a film about a timber family in 1970s Oregon.  Large sections of the film are just logging action (like a Discovery Channel Reality Show).  Newman stars (and directs) this one.  The family dynamic here is weird (and a bit icky by the time it is done).  The main family the ""Stampers"" as a unit are both the hero and the villain to this tale.  Newman's direction is sharp as hell.  3 1/2 stars out of 5.  Fair warning the homophobia (while a product of the time) is pretty strong in this one.<>Paul Newman's Sometimes a Great Notion is a powerful and evocative film that somehow feels incomplete.  Perhaps the story by Ken Kesey is too complex, too nuanced to be told in a mere two hours and deserved the mini-series treatment.  The film has wonderful outdoor cinematography and creates a frightening ambiance, based on the awesome power of nature but also on the constant threat of violence from the striking local townspeople.  There were also a number of things that didn't work for me.  The sense of inevitable doom, from which there was no relief right from the opening frames, seemed heavy even by the standards of melodrama.  Also, Lee Remick's character must have had lots to do in the novel, but is mostly just eye candy here, with some occasional glances and sighs that I think only those who read the book could grasp.  And that brings us to the back-stories, which apparently fueled the personalities and intrigue but which are barely developed.  Paul Newman, Michael Sarrazin and Richard Jaekel are very good, but I found Henry Fonda a bit too one-dimensional, a bit over-drawn.  Finally, I found the music and ending to be out of place in the portrayal of an epic battle and grandiose family.<>A film about a family that will not join the union strike and is therefore alienated by the community which is a storyline that is not unique but the performances and the script writing for the latter three fifths of the film make this film stand out. I thought the film moved along pretty slowly at the beginning and believed that this was going to be a forgettable film. The cliched swearing script became a bit boring. However, the Stamper's family more personal interactions were acted and written well and the family's discussions with the union and the town was also intriguing. Although, I did not really care for the cinema owner and his struggles, which could have been replaced by the Stamper's personal lumberjack friends instead. His death didn't leave much of an impact on the family either. The scene between Hank and Joe Ben was very well directed and scripted. You hoped that there was some way Joe Ben could be saved, that nothing would happen to him after Henry's serious injury. When I read Tarantino's review of the film where he said the film contained one of the greatest scenes in early seventies cinema, I was very sceptical. However, after watching the film he is 100% correct. The Joe Ben-Hank scene seemed to be so impactful that the Academy nominated the actor who played Joe Ben, Richard Jaeckel, for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. I thought his performance was the weakest in that category for that year as his contemporaries had much more scenes to chew on, but he still gave a good performance. Henry Ford's performance, especially in the hospital, was also very good and I would not have been against him being nominated for his performance. The ending of the film is satisfying where Hank and Lee go down the river with the logs and give the finger to the unions. I would've liked to have more time understanding the union's side of the story as I thought was pretty important to the story. I should also note that I thought the cinematography in this film was weak for a film that mostly takes place in the countryside. Overall, a film that, while not as good as the author's other film adaptation, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, had strong performances, a good script and very memorable scenes.<>Based on the Ken Kesey novel, Sometimes a Great Notion follows the Stamper family, independent Oregon loggers involved in a dispute with the striking local logging union.  As the patriarch and the oldest son, Henry Fonda and Paul Newman fuel the film with strong performances.  Unfortunately, the movie is hindered by odd camera angles and strangely framed shots (including aerial shots that look as though they were filmed on a Super 8 camera tied to a balloon), as well as a tinny and cheesy score of instrumental country music.  Most notable is the infamous death scene on the river, a powerful and prolonged segment that will be remembered long after the movie has ended.<>It drags at times but the actors make it work.<>If you're really into the logging business, this movie's for you.  Since I'm sure that's just about nobody, this movie's pretty dull.  The only scenes worth watching are the tragic events near the end.<>Just saw this for the first time about 2 weeks ago.

Really, though, he's Quixote, stuck in a noble past and wilfully disconnected from a present that jostles uncomfortably close.<>A staggering misfire that's both unambitious and bloated.<>Personally, for all its frustrating elements it is worthy viewing of anyone who consider themselves filmgoers.<>The end result is fun and frustrating in almost equal measure.<>It's a messy, unfocused film that seems so in awe of its own existence that it can't quite summon the energy to tell a worthwhile story.","Its an unusual film. Use all-time flashbacks and have mind clueless.<>The critics downvoting this moving are sadly unimaginative, and I don't feel like they understand Don Quixote maybe. This is a fantastical fever dream, a journey of self and realization. A getting back to your roots story. I think maybe they never fully spoon feed us who our protagonist wanted to be, but they bring to life who he truly is by the end. 
This is a hilarious, delirious, and entrancing adventure that I'll happily watch again sometime soon. Comparing it to other work by Gilliam feels lazy and sad. Stop expecting storytellers to cater to your every expectation and enjoy the ride.<>How can people not see the art, passion, vigor, song, fight, quest, glamour of a beautiful project

I often wonder if my fellow man is a zombie
For they adore the most dead films and whence life comes they mock it<>A very undervalued film that instead deserves a lot because it is hilarious and very entertaining, with a really perticular plot full of twists and really interesting parts.<>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote seems to be Terry Gilliam channeling his inner Robert Altman - a criticism of the film industry, more specifically the poisoned dream that it promises to many before pulling the rug out from beneath them - but also featuring some of the Gilliam stylistic cues, particularly cynicism and surrealism. Driver stars as a film director who happens to fall in with a man who believes himself to be the genuine Don Quixote as a result of Driver's own efforts on a film years prior, and the two embark on a strange modern rendition of the errant knight's wayward journey. While Gilliam always has an idiosyncratic approach, a lot of the thematic content is relatively typical, particularly Driver's somewhat generic redemptive arc and a general pining for the simplicity of classical romanticism, wondering if it has a place in the modern world. But, the notoriously long production of this film still resulted in some distinctive attributes, particularly the practical visual design, which takes advantage of on-location work in Spain and makes the countryside look beautiful even when it's grimy. 

Despite a revolving door of acting talent, the ultimate pairing of Driver and Jonathan Pryce play quite well off each other and the latter is particularly suited to the role given his tendency to take on dottering characters (imagine Robert Duvall, a previous casting choice, in his place), but even with Gilliam's direction a lot of the underlying themes seem a bit tired and the plot is somewhat messy. (2.5/5)<>I laughed, I cried, I was confused. It was a really beautiful trip.<>It's nothing other than sad really, and the sometimes terribly direct and honest founder of Hand Made Films, the late George Harrison, would probably just say - Terry Gilliam seems to have lost his touch. The magic is gone. Though there are some qualities with The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, the film is shamed by lousy semi bizarre humor, amateurish overacting and a partwise poorly developed plot. Neither Jonathan Pryce or the late Jean Rochefort could save this, and one should expect better from the man behind Brazil, 12 Monkeys, The Fisher King and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Sorry, but you'll always be measured by your biggest achievements.<>Uma viagem diferente, uma versão de Dom Quixote inusitada, agradável de se assistir, um tanto exagerado, mais nada  prejudicial à emoção, que nem tenho tanta emoção assim, engraçadinho em alguns momentos, entretanto chato é maçante durante o decorrer do filme...<>Sometimes I wonder how one of the greatest directors of all time can do a movie as bad as this.

Emily White, played exceptionally by Katie Leclerc, inherited the farm from her deceased father. As the farm gets further in debt, Emily faces the challenge of having to raise $400,000 in 3 weeks (until Christmas Eve) in order to save the farm and not be forced to sell to a dairy conglomerate or, even worse, a housing development. Emily passionately wants to keep the farm and does everything in her power (with the help of her Mother and few others) to raise the money and pull off a ""Christmas Miracle"".  Christmas a la Mode has a very good, believable storyline. This combined with the excellent performances particularly of Emily White (by Katie Leclerc) and her mother Susan White (by Kathy Harum) make Christmas a la Mode a highly recommended watch any time of the year.","Mark Donadio, Miriam Marcus",,,,,,,

Certain movies seem to follow you throughout your life. After you initially, encounter these movies they manage to resurface every few years or so. One of the films on my list of these movies is a 1987 film directed by Arthur Penn, 'Dead of Winter.' Which fundamentally was a horror movie woven throughout with strong influences of a psychological thriller? The top built stars were naturally at a higher level of audience recognition than they would be today, Mary Steenburgen and Roddy McDowall. Affording this movie a distinctive aura of timelessness was derived from the strength of the performances, a solid script, and direction by one of Hollywood's legends. Those of you who have noted the director's surname, yes, he is related to Sean Penn, he was his father. After watching this in the theater subsequently recorded while channel surfing on cable is eventually adding the VHS tape and subsequently the DVD to my burgeoning collection. The reason to consider this film after so many years is that it has become part of the growing trend of remastering cinephiles' favorites into high definition for a Blu-ray release. I have had a discussion with some young people were in the process of building their movie library. Some may argue that there is little reason to repurchase some of these older films on Blu-ray. I couldn't disagree more adamantly. A significant number of Hollywood movies you 35mm film as the preferred medium of the filmmaker. The amount of detail captured in each frame of this film is highly conducive to provide the necessary detail and resolution to deliver a near flawless than 1080p video. It is possible to catch a myriad of details that you undoubtedly missed on any of the technically lesser formats cited above. Watching this movie on a Blu-ray disc was showcased with a modern layer, HDTV audio provided by home theater receiver capable of producing distinct multichannel sound. I've seen this movie the times it watching this new release was in many raising more exciting experience provided in that dark movie theater 30 years ago.

To help establish the psychological thriller as a part of the horror genre the opening is constructed as a teaser frequently used to plant some images in the minds of the audience that would become important later on. In this instance you see a woman driving to a train station on New Year's Eve. She retrieves a small suitcase that is revealed to contain the considerable amount of cash. She will not have a chance during the New Year to enjoy such a tidy sum, later that night she found herself strangled, and her ring finger amputated. The focus of the film slides into the current year. Katie McGovern (Mary Steenburgen) is a struggling actress living in New York City with a husband Rob Sweeney (William Russ). At the moment her brother is staying with them for a visit. Like many performers who are determined to break into their craft, Katie routinely scours the papers and magazines prominent in the entertainment industry. He notices an advertisement for one open casting call and immediately goes to try out. Much of surprise and delight Katie hired on the spot by the man managing your additions, Mr. Murray (Roddy McDowall). Those who are not familiar with his work that eschews the requirement of transforming into a chimpanzee, Mr. McDowell had been considered one of the most sought after character actors who occasionally had the opportunity to be the leading man. This film showcased one of the many archetypes that he excelled in performing, the meticulous mid-management executive or majordomo service to a powerful man. He was able to perfectly combine a façade of almost my friendliness with the distinctive undercurrents of a man who was mercilessly efficient.

Mr. Murray explains that the final approval before assuming the role in the production is dependent on his employer. Despite the employment rather Mr. Murray insists that that meeting takes place immediately. Understandably, many in the audience might think why a young woman would travel out into a dark and stormy night with a man she spent less than an hour ago? If this question lingers for in your mind more than a few minutes that I am quite certain that you have never been desperate to find work overcome the harsh articles to achieving your life's goal. I order to make sense of the film; it is advantageous to place yourself Katie's mindset as someone so entranced by the opportunity presented that she can only think of the fame and glory that inevitably this opportunity would bring. The idea of careening off into the night with a stranger to a remote mansion becomes inconsequential. This is a necessary process promote horror films, but I do feel that credit goes to the screenwriters, Marc Shmuger and Mark Malone for providing at least a modicum of the rationale for the behavior. Mr. Murray brought Katie to a remote upstate, the location of the screen test and the approval of the producer of the film, wheelchair-bound Dr. Joseph Lewis (Jan Rube), was a psychiatrist entering the field of filmmaking. Katie's husband understandably was filled with significant trepidation about his wife's decision, but he was reluctant about standing in the way of his wife's ambition and Mr. Murray so reassuringly affable and convincing that he assuaged his doubts.

Dr. Lewis explains to Katie that the reason behind needing to rush the process to such a degree that Katie was replacing was a diva (and the streams of unreasonable demands stormed off the set and a huff. Because scenes of the film had been shot already, Mr. Murray explained to Katie that she would have to undergo a bit of a makeover for sure that she looks as close to the first actress as possible. She tries to call the husband to check in but is unable to get a dial tone, which is blamed on the storm bringing down phone lines. At the time that this movie's production was at a time when there is a greater simplicity in crafting the isolation so crucial for most psychological thrillers and horror films. This is a simpler time more straightforward technology. Isolation was achievable by cutting a few wires and made clear to the audience by the lack of a dial tone. In more current stories some contrivance must be done as to why cell phone will not work leading either to the statement ""I'm not getting any bars"" or ""my batteries are dead.""

One aspect of the situation that dotted the audience more Katie seems to appreciate that for a 'feature film 'there is a distinct lack of any supporting crew. Mr. Murray demonstrated expertise in such an eclectic range of functions as hair and makeup to lighting and camera work. One connection to reality situation like this is that in an independent movie is not uncommon for individuals to assume a plethora of roles in the production. The importance of this observation within the context of the story is that it trims down the cast of the bare essentials. As noted, isolation is critical to creating and maintaining a pervasive sense of isolation in the prospective victim. Having Katie confined to a mansion in upstate New York during a blizzard is an ideal and organic way of cutting off any possible systems. The only people in the house with Katie are the ubiquitous Mr. Murray and mysterious Dr. Lewis.

There is a distinct possibility that you will find yourself second-guessing every plot point, surrounded by the feeling that you know everything that is about to happen. Truthfully, this is applicable for many examples of these genres, but it is vital to keep in mind that a movie such as this is not the destination but the journey. Mr. Penn handles the telling of the story expertise and care. Arthur Penn has been sharpening his impressive skill since the early 50s having been instrumental in the early days of television haven't been involved with such groundbreaking program as 'Playhouse 90' and 'Goodyear Playhouse.' His contribution to cinema is even more impressive having held such iconic movies as 'The Miracle Worker,' 'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'Little Big Man.' Although this movie is not able to provide an optimal showcase for such astonishing talent, Mr. Penn's indisputable stamp is obvious in the pervasive style of this movie. The pacing manages to captivate the attention of the audience firmly holding it in place as a suspended simmers also be reaching the boiling point at the film's conclusion.",,,$2.2M,,R,,Surround,

It is a hard watch for some scenes and will make you ponder life during others. Uwe Boll is a genius and this is one of his best yet. If you're intelligent, you're going to love this film.<>PETA delivered some hardcore footage of animal cruelty. Be warned.<>2007's ""Seed"" is a retro-slasher from Uwe Boll, meant to lament a frustration over his cold reception into the horror world. More people seem to hate him than like him, it seems. There has only been a handful of films that Boll has directed that are in my wheelhouse as far as what I will watch. I actually liked more of those than I hated. I can't speak for him based on all his material because a lot of the films he has made aren't films I would watch regardless of the director or star.

 As far as ""Seed"" is concerned, I found the film to be a dark, graphic, and blunt expressionist nightmare. The film stars Will Sanderson, Michael Paré, Ralf Möller, Jodelle Ferland, Thea Gill and Andrew Jackson. The story gives rise to a brutal, stoic killer that seems to kill for the shear pleasure of the torturous process of killing his victims. Not sure the motive, or reason for the obsession other than it appears to be his fetish, not the act of taking the life but the process by which the body finally breaks, along with the gruesome and macabre aftermath. All of which Uwe Boll forces the viewer to experience head on. 

""Seed"" is filmed in heavy atmospheric surrealism, blended with moments of splatter gore. Set in the 70's, the backdrop is as macabre and depressing as the notion of witnessing the life leave someone you love. The killer, Seed, is a large, terrifying force of cruelty and death, shown completely and utterly without remorse or compassion. I am not even sure if he understands an actual difference between right and wrong. It wasn't really established. Normally that would be an issue, however Boll frames the whole story as if we stepped into the middle of a horror unfolding. It forces you to either check out completely or set up and figure out the situation as you go. I actually enjoyed that because it made the viewing experience slightly uncomfortable. 

The acting is pretty good in ""Seed"". Most of the film is build on tense emotional interactions with limited dialog. The soundtrack and character conflicts tell most of the story. The dialog that does happen is based in the present with now ""wordy"" reflections or deep philosophical speeches to justify what we are seeing. The film really does feel classic in nature. The cinematography reminded me of ""Hellraiser: Inferno"", with heavy noir elements. For me personally there is more that works here than goes wrong. 

The special effects and soundtrack combine to give ""Seed"" that total horror feel. The slasher side of Boll's vision is strong in the kill/death sequences. Most are practical effects that really push the comfortability level-moving into heavy splatter / gore territory. The downside is that, in a couple of the scenes, CGI spoils the overall effect of realism that is created by most of the other deaths. Uwe Boll has a habit of taking the effects one step to far into the tacky -where the CGI becomes too obvious to let the scene have a strong impact. Plus some of the sound effects, although very creepy and effect, seem like rip-offs of films that have come before ""Seed"". But overall, ""Seed"" is an entertaining, brutal piece of slasher/ horror that most fans will enjoy-I did. -<>Another pretty CGI gore fest pretty bad<>More garbage from Uwe Boll. About half way through the film there is a scene where a victim is slowly bludgeoned to death with an axe, besides having the dubious honour of being the best part of the movie this was also analogous to the experience of watching the feature. 'Seed' is badly made in almost every aspect but it is its lack of tension which is the major failing.<>How on earth does shit like this get made...?<>A decent film by Uwe Boll.<>Why is his head always covered?  Boring and stupid movie.  Not scary, no gore!  Watching people starved to death and rotted is not a horror movie, it's called a science show!<>the video he is watching is real footage of the chinese furtrade. i seen the same footage on youtube before it was removed and obviously uwe did aswell and used them in his movie. the electricution part was pretty cool but there is one scene where the killer picks apart a girls skull with numorous hammer swings for a overly long time. the blood looked fake and the scene was pointless so i turned it off at that.","Uwe Boll, Dan Clarke, Shawn Williamson",,,,,,,

cosa hanno in comune questi trentottenni? Semplice, 20 anni fa erano compagni di scuola. Ma sopratutto erano amici, erano un gruppo. Poi è successo qualcosa e il gruppo si è frantumato. Ma tra poco torneranno ad esserlo, almeno per qualche giorno: il Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione ha annullato il loro esame di maturità e lo dovranno rifare. Pena l'annullamento di tutti i titoli successivamente conseguiti. E così li vedremo di nuovo insieme, come ai vecchi tempi, con qualche ruga di più e qualche capello di meno. Con la voglia di risentire il sapore della giovinezza e la consapevolezza, più o meno profonda, che quel periodo è passato. Una commedia brillante e sentimentale che riporta una generazione a confrontarsi con la vita che dopo 20 anni è andata da tutte le parti, fra sogni e disillusioni.<>Very good Italian comedy...<>Il tema portante e bizzarro del film (il ritorno alla prova di maturita') in verita' non si dimostra altro che un pretesto per mettere in scena un quadro di una generazione. Ne esce fuori un prodotto godibile, divertente, con quella giusta dose di romanticismo ingenuo, sicuramente ben recitato (memorabile Ricky Menphis). Colpisce l'ottima scelta delle musiche. Non si grida al capolavoro, ma questa e' certamente una commedia da punto di riferimento per tutti i quarantenni!<>Expected more fun...<>Very good Italian comedy about a group of friends finding each other again 20 years after leaving school. VERY Italian. Very funny and very casually sexy. Highly recommended. Apart from the reason they get back together (extremely dubious I would think) this charms and seduces throughout. Is it Rom, is it Com? Well, yes, although not in the way an American film (even a good one like Crazy Stupid Love) would be. Do yourself a favour and see it.<>Un'occasione mancata.

Connors' War,,41,2 Reviews,250+ Ratings,,spilled,"Action, Crime, Drama",English,Nick Castle,D.

Mercifully, an experimental serum has temporarily restored his eyesight so that he may complete the operation. But, when Connors has seemingly fulfilled his mission, he realizes that his superiors may be dangerous criminals who have manipulated him.

This movie isn't outright terrible, but it certainly is the very core definition of what a 'B-Movie' is. While the special effects are okay, the script is borderline terrible. I know Treach, a rapper, is supposed to be playing a convict turned elite government agent, and yet, he still talks and curses like a typical rapper! I find that hilarious! And so does his mentor, the bad guy of the movie, Brooks. Nia Peeples is a mix of brains and beauty, and yet, her character progressively gets dumber as the movie goes on. And Treach is playing himself more than anything. A "" 'hood James Bond,"" really. It's like this whole script was written by the worst student in film school; the aspiring rapper turned screenwright.

To sum it up: Connors lost his eyesight via an explosion during a botched mission to save the First Lady from terrorists. He's recruited three years later by his old boss, Brooks, for one last mission, in which, he'll be able to get his eyesight back via some technology that involves a rabbit and cats' ""eyes glowing in the dark because of a mirror behind their retinas"" technique. Basically, light will refract back into his eyes with this procedure and he'll be able to see again, but only temporarally. Once Connors steals a thermos from a military base and hands it to his old boss Brooks, agents put out a hit on him and Dr. Amanda and they go on the run, to find out the truth, which is Connors' hero, mentor, and former boss, got fired by the government and has gone on an insane revenge plot to kill everyone with a secret bioweapon, which Connors' JUST gave to him! Now, it's up to him, Dr. Amanda, and Connors old Secret Service arch rival to stop Brooks' revenge plot before Connors loses his eyesight and everyone dies. And that's basically it. The end is kind of lame, but at least, less than predictable. Blu Mankuma as Brooks, although kind of a Ghetto old man, probably gives the best performance and his character is kind of Ghetto, but he's also very intelligent and meticulous, as well.

All in all, this was a funny 90 minutes, and aside the unprofessionalism of everyone's characters who are supposed 'professionals', this was entertaining enough. A good B-Movie.

Skip Robinson is married to Pat and has two kids, Toby and Jenny. For some time he's been wanting to make a life for himself and his family his own way. He hates his job and the city of Los Angeles. It's always like he's unloading on his wife and the kids. 
So they all decide to pack up and build a house for themselves far in the woods. 
They're flown to the Rocky Mountains where they discover raccoons, bears, deer, and all sorts of wildlife. They learn skills such as hunting, woodworking, fishing, making medicine etc.
It's a very simple premise. Something that I suppose certain individuals can attribute to being sick of the crowded, overwhelming city life. There's gotta be a certain amount of people that just want to relax and not face the hardships of civilization and get in touch with their outdoorsyness. 
Director Stewart Raffill tells a family-friendly tale about living with nature in a more peaceful, quieter and simple setting. There's many bad things but also beautiful things.

I would watch this over and over as a kid. The Good Son doesn't quite hold up as it used to and is pretty tame for an R rated feature. It is cool to see Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin acting at this age. Culkin delivers a good performance as a disturbed twelve year old doing evil deeds. Wood gives a good performance as well seeming very mature for his age. Storywise the writers squander an unsettling premise. Not even an hour and half long this movie could have done so much more and focused more on the psychological stuff in depth. It felt like it rushes to get to the movie's final act. The movie is a pretty standard generic thriller we've seen plenty of times before, only memorable because it's kids acting this out instead of adults. I'll always have a soft spot for this movie as I'm a fan of the actors, but if you're not a fan you may find this dated and dull. I do find the ending interesting and bold. Shame the credits roll without having a little more time with the characters to explore the repercussions and consequences.<>It just isn't a good movie.

There is a killer on the loose. Young women are found laying around Las Vegas, drenched for blood and with holes in they're necks. After the fifth murder or so the police finally listen to a journalist that think there's a vampire in town. It turns out he's right. He is tracing the murderer himself, just to get the real story. He get's up in the mix, plenty.

An OK approach to the classic vampire thing. It's OK, but nothing more. Never scary, never impressive or really exciting - the killer is known for us way too early. It's on auto pilot and it's bringing nothing more than it needs too, but it does have some suspence at least.

There is a follow up to this film, supposed to be almost as good as this one but I'm not sure if I will give it a peep. I liked the fact that this TV-film was short and not dragging, but there is not that much else here for me, sadly.

4.5 out of 10 jars of blood.<>Ahead of its time in surprising ways, this influential series focuses on a reporter who's often involved in chasing murders of a supernatural nature. Kolchak is not well liked by the police or anyone in authority and most commonly finds himself blacklisted or persecuted. It's easy to spot the influence on the X-Files. Where Kolchak differs from Mulder is that he's only a reporter and has no actual authority to involve himself in crimes. This results in each episode requiring a lot more busywork to get to the plot. It's also fine with unrationalized monsters and doesn't really try to mess with the creatures' established formulae, making the resolution of the mystery less complicated. The government conspiracy is also halfbaked, and I'd argue that's an important element for a show like this to succeed. Isolated police departments apparently agree on a uniform coverup of any supernatural case just because they don't want people to think they're nuts. More than a little lame. Kolchak himself is charming, funny, rather rundown, and more than a little cocky. He's fun to watch and keeps the show grounded during even its largest flights of fancy. Performances are also good; excellent even, given that we're talking about a TV series from the '70s. Quality is much like a proper movie, one of those dark early '70s gritty crime dramas perhaps. With vampires.<>Yes there were episodes that sucked but even those were enjoyable, watching Kolchak battle Vincenzo and the cops along with the selected Monster of the Week. But when it shone, the Night Stalker illuminated the barren TV landscape with wit, imagination and a whimsical take on the typical horror genre. Perhaps, in the end, that's what doomed it; neither fish nor fowl, the dimwit network types couldn't pigeonhole it. Darren McGavin's Kolchak and his irreverent approach to journalism and authority gave the series an anti-hero that wasn't young, hip and good looking. In retrospect, the show never had a chance. But it still holds up well, 43 years later. My fave episodes were Horror in the Heights, Bad Medicine and Legacy of Terror.<>Stellar acting. Great stories with writing unlike anything before or after. Let the special effects be what they are, and you have one of the best TV shows of the 70s. Should have run much longer.<>Stupid cheesy cheap. But I love it.<>One of those old friends from my youth in the 70's. Karl and Tony were so great together.

I used to wait impatiently for this show to come on every week so I could see what new monster Kolchak would encounter.  Would it be a vampire?  Maybe a werewolf?  A zombie?  Where else could you tune in and find Erik Estrada about to be sacrificed to an Aztec god?  Or witness Tom Skerritt transform himself into a rottweiler?  Good, clean, spooky fun.",,,,,,,,

Good for fans of Arkin and silly 70s physical comedies.<>Easily one of the funniest movies ever made and certainly a forgotten classic that shockingly few people under 40 have taken the opportunity to enjoy.

We used to quote this film daily when I was in grammar school, often without realizing it.

Plus the shots of old NYC are priceless.<>Now, even more than when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago, I love it. It is a truism that ""The artist strikes from the transcendent"", and there is one moment in particular in this gem of a movie where that strike is very pronounced...but I won't spoil it for you by telling you what it was for me. Falk and Arkin are fabulous. It is a very funny movie, but even more than that is the humanity it reveals. It might very well have been titled: The In-laws and Out-laws.<>This is one, crazy, surreal film as clever in story as A fish Called Wanda ,plus the added Mel Brook like characters that fuel this hilarious trip!<>I was a bit worried that The In-Laws would not appeal to me because it has a story structure that I generally hate. I have always struggled with movies that establish a likable character and then spend the entire runtime torturing the poor guy/girl. I have a nasty tendency to sympathize acutely with the character, so it feels like I’m the one being put through the ringer. Sure enough that seems to be the basic plot structure of The In-Laws and I could see myself hating this movie if not for one thing...the cast. I did sympathize with Alan Arkin’s character to some degree, but he plays the character with such a humorous desperation that I was chuckling rather than cringing. He has this tendency to shut down as if he’s shell-shocked and can’t even figure out what to say, and every time he went there I was genuinely laughing out loud. His counterpart, Peter Falk, is also perfect for his role in The In-Laws. He has this light-hearted personality where it feels like he is completely unphased by all the insanity going on around them. Since he’s not taking things too seriously, it also allows me to not worry so much about the bad things happening to Arkin’s character. The entire film is a little heightened so that it almost feels farcical, but not to the extreme. You can’t spend too much time overthinking the logic of the film, because it would fall apart under that kind of scrutiny, but it still has enough narrative structure to tell a compelling story. It’s this goofy tone that allowed me to have a great time laughing along as each new adventure began. The In-Laws might not be the greatest comedy film of all time, but it feels like a classic that I should have seen sooner. I expect to laugh at this one for years to come.<>Alan Arkin and Peter Falk make a neat team as a Dentist and a CIA agent in this crazy comedy of a miss-matched pair in a series of desperate situations. Whether in NY City or a foreign dictator's war-torn desert nation they are constantly in peril and uproarious danger. Many funny lines and crazy characters make this a fast-moving romp from start to finish. Dialogue is slightly rough at the start but settles down to concentrate on the fun situations as it moves along. Will please fans of the two stars and features a very funny turn by Richard Libertini (that has to be seen!) as a crazy general.<>Wonderful comedic performances by Falk and Arkin.<>This movie is a national treasure.  When it came out, everything was fresh, and after it, it was all copied in other movies.  So while you might think the jokes are old, its only because it was copied.  This movie is insane, and the tagline ""the certifiably crazy persons movie"" is no hype, just honest.  I frankly loved this movie.  Every joke seems to work.  And Arkin and Falk are the dream team.  The people behind the making of this movie are geniuses.  I just couldn't stop laughing.  There are just sooo many lines that work.  Vince is obviously clinically insane, and seems to take relish in proving it every 5 minutes.  We are witness to a clearly average person, played by Arkin, being slowly and steadily driven into Falk's insanity.  We watch Arkin go through the things we would go through, as we fast-tracked to the booby-hatch.  Clearly, Falk wants to completely destroy Arkins life, and is supremely unrelenting in this regard.  You might think he'll get a break now and then, but it never does happen.  It's just one disaster after another.  Each one worse then the last.  You can't help but put yourself in his place.  Arkin is taking him down his rabbit hole, and there is no coming back.  The movie is lovable, as are the characters.  In the cinematic world, this is art, crafted with skill and love.  If you can't laugh at this movie, you should see a doctor.  You're probably dead.  That or psychotic.  This movie is in my top 10 funniest movies EVER.",,,,,PG,,,

The camera-work was great, really showed off a gritty / tough side of new york that we used to see in NY Crime films! and it looked like it was a bigger budget than what it says it was on IMDB lol!

Fast-moving, gritty, weirdly entertaining. You can see what I mean in the first 5"".<>Johnny Cool is a disappointing film. It is about exiled American gangster Colini who sends his protégé-killer Giordano to the USA to eliminate Colini's mob enemies. Henry Silva and Elizabeth Montgomery give terrible performances. The screenplay is badly written. William Asher did a horrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.<>Scared money never made money.

A Sicilian gangster known as Johnny Cool is caught by American authorities and exported back to Italy.  Once in Italy, he trains a man to take his name, responsibilities, and send him back to the US to assassinate those responsible for his exile.  The assassin pretends to be Johnny Cool and quickly falls for a girl.  If his secret gets out, he'll quickly become a target of rival gangs.  Can the assassin maintain his secret identity and complete his mission?

""Do I know you?""
""No.""
""Then what are you looking at?""

William Asher, director of Night Warning, Fireball 500, Bikini Beach, Beach Blanket Bingo, Beach Party, The 27th Day, The Shadow on the Window, and Leather Gloves, delivers Johnny Cool.  The storyline for this picture is just okay and fairly straightforward.  It is a bit bland in parts but the concept was interesting.  The acting is just okay and the cast includes Henry Silva, Elizabeth Montgomery, Sammy Davis Jr, Jim Backus, Richard Anderson, and Brad Dexter.

""What do you do?""
""My best.""

I came across this picture on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and decided to give it a shot.  This was fairly solid and had potential.  This wasn't a masterpiece, but a different type of gangster picture for this era.  Overall, I recommend giving it a viewing if nothing else is on, but I wouldn't add it to my collection.

""He'll be alone.  He's always been alone.""

Grade: C<>very cool gangsta pic plus bewitched- the powers= this 1<>Delightfully tawdry early 60s crime drama staring Henry Silva and Elizabeth Montgomery in a pre-Bewitched role. The story is about a deported gangster living in Sicily training an Italian convict, Silva, to take over his US operations. Silva then proceeded to violently dismantle the US mob operations his mentor had stolen from him. The film has the same sort of trashy appeal as Mamie Van Doren's ""Guns, Girls, and Gangsters,"" except this film is slickly made by director William Asher, who I mostly associate with the vastly different Beach Party films, and has a strong supporting cast of character actors, including Richard Anderson, Jim Backus, Joey Bishop, Brad Dexter, Mort Sahl, Telly Savalas, Sammy Davis Jr. Elisha Cook Jr. and Joe Turkel. There's even a jazzy Bill May score to boot. Best of all is seeing the gorgeous Elizabeth Montgomery playing Dare Guinness, a beautifulshowgirl-type, miles away from the wholesome image she crafted as Samantha on ""Bewitched."" Tough, violent and sexy, this film plays like a very entertaining Roger Corman ripoff of a ""Point Blank."" Well worth watching for 60s crime film fans.<>""The man in Rome dies or we all die.""-Vincenzo 'Vince' Santangelo (Telly Savalas)

Personally, I didn't find Johnny to be to cool, but the rest of the movie was. Especially the lovely, Elizabeth Montgomery who had so many memorable lines. Poor Johnny never saw it coming. Good gangster drama.

A brutally honest movie and an amazing departure from the likes of films like God's Army which I couldn't bring myself to finish.<>""Falling"" is incredible, exhausting, brutal, devastating, and ultimately very rewarding, and it's one of the most powerful films I've ever seen--a deeply wounded cry caught on film (the opening scene, with Dutcher very literally cursing the heavens, is wrenching, and the film rarely lets up from the relentless anguish, anger, sadness, and searching those opening moments establish); an intense, immediate, and very personal drama that hurtles you into the mind of its central character and keeps you there for 82 minutes (and probably longer); and a fascinating commentary on and dissection of the underbelly of L.A. film culture (it's one of the most interesting films ever to look at the inherent voyeurism of cinema, right up there with Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" and Hitchcock's ""Rear Window""). There are some problems with the film, I think, but they are minor compared to the cinematic storm Dutcher unleashes, asking questions of faith that are hard to answer, making observations about the very structure of moviemaking that are inescapable, and offering a battering emotional experience that is utterly immersive. Dutcher's performance is particularly special--it's incredibly real, and the references to his own life and career give the film a stinging sense of honesty. This is an amazing movie.<>A brutal and brilliant film. In 82 minutes, Dutcher eclipses (and builds upon) his previous three films with a thoughtful look at the way culture and faith clash.

Overall, this is a fantastic movie that deserves more recognition.<>This film shows the lives of four men who are bravely traveling across five states in order to promote the adoption of beautiful horses. The horses are being reproduced at fast and high levels, making them the complete opposite of an indigenous species. Moreover, this film contains many exciting scenes. For instance, one cowboy was kicked in the head when attempting to remove cactus thorns. This film also shows the gorgeous scenery of many states, scenery that is usually overlooked. In retrospect, chua film also consists of a few slow parts, like when the men go fishing. Overall, this film does a great job at educating its viewers by giving them insight on the lives of cowboys, as well as the struggles of traveling long distances.<>Unbranded is a very good movie. I admire the men's courage to travel such a long journey. I felt sad that they left on of the horses because its muscle or bone split in the back of the body. It was a meaningful movie. I cried when the horse tried to climb up the steep mountain but slip so it fell and died. The donkey was courageous. Even though it was small, it was traveling far with the horses. In fact, I realize the importance of survival of the fittest. If the horses were not trained for months before leaving to travel, many would not have been able to surpass the harsh conditions they have faced as witnessed during the movie. Overall, I gave this movie a four out of five rating because I love how I can implement my knowledge on A.P. Environmental Science in this movie. It made the movie more meaningful to me since I can witness the impact of biodiversity and the importance of enforcing laws, acts, and solutions in order to maintain and increase biodiversity. - Marjie Gopez<>Beautifully filmed and scored documentary about four recent college grads that made this movie to inspire people to adopt wild horses.

After watching this feel-good movie the character bonding and determination is family friendly and fun to watch. This movie shows the struggle between the friends but tells a journey of meaning. This should be an example of why the horses should not be kept in an enclosed captivity becoming useless. There could be other productivities the government can provide for the wild grazing horses living up north.

Not even worthy of a proper review.<>Parasitic (Tim Martin, 2012)

After I watched the ridiculously bad Poker Run (q.v., elsewhere this ish), I thought I had pretty much hit the bottom of the barrel for the week's viewing. It turns out I couldn't have been more wrong, and the reason for that is Parasitic, a brutally bad attempt at a horror film whose average rating on IMDB right now is a woeful 2.0. If it had enough votes to appear in the IMDB Bottom 100, that would rank it somewhere between #11 and #31. If you're looking for a second opinion, head over to Rotten Tomatoes. There, it has the distinction of being one of only a handful of films whose audience rating is zero percent. (Note: these numbers were mined on Feb. 14, 2013.) If it helps you to gauge how entirely awful this movie is, other films with 2.0 ratings at IMDB include Glitter, Track of the Moon Beast, and House of the Dead. Even the legendarily awful Bill Cosby flick Leonard Part 6 has a 2.2 rating. Yes, it's that bad. Normally, when it comes to movies that have been uniformly savaged by the crowds at IMDB and/or RT, I will attempt to find some small facet of that movie worth defending. I've even tried to defend Manos: The Hands of Fate. (Come on, catfights!) But Parasitic is a movie so awful that I cannot find a single thing-not one minor acting performance, not one camera angle, not even a snippet of the soundtrack, that makes this dog anything less than one of the worst movies ever made.

Plot: A strip club has closed for the night, and the late-night crew are trying to get cashed out and go home. Problem is, owner Val (Bianca Holland in her first screen role), who's a control freak and insists on cashing everyone out, is nowhere to be found. See, she went to the restroom and was attacked, and infected, by some sort of space parasite. And so now she's going to hunt down the rest of the crew and kill them one by one.

There's nothing here you haven't seen at least a dozen times before, but to the movie's dubious credit, I don't think you've ever seen it done quite so ineptly. It's just terrible all the way round, form the acting to the direction to the soundtrack to the lighting to the laughable CGI. There is nothing-nothing at all-about this movie that could cause me to recommend it to anyone. Please, for the love of bottle rockets, avoid this garbage.  1/2<>The presence of some good old fashioned non-CGI special effects and the memorable Bianca Holland (the bra was making it hard to breath I guess?) manages to somewhat overcome some bad acting and dull side characters.<>Really bad.

It was very lovable. British romantic comedies are a bit more complex than american ones, so I found that with this rom com.

I enjoyed the film<>Ho Hum and Love Hewitt in this is preety average.<>It's a decent Brit flick which isn't as bad as RT makes it out to be. Jennifer Love Hewitt is actually a pretty decent actress and not as bad as she's made out to be, she actually pulls off a pretty good English accent. The film is a Valentine's Day flick; it's about a woman called Alice (Love-Hewitt) whose marriage to husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) seems to be loosing it's spark so she sends him saucy messages pretending to be his anonymous secret admirer in hope of putting the spart back into their marriage. However he's being unfaithful to her and little does Alice know that Sam's best friend Archie (Dougray Scott) is in love with her.

It's really cliche and predictable, but it's quite funny and it's good to watch an English film compared to a Hollywood film. The performances are decent and the characters apart from Sam an his Russian mistress Katya are likeable. Alice's sex mad sister, Flick (Kate Miles) is really funny and gives most of the laughs in this film. I have to agree that the script is very cliche and it's nothing original, but for a Valentine's Day movie it's OK. It's not ridiculously soppy. Whilst I'm not a fan of these kind of films I do enjoy the British humour and films set in London for a change being British myself. 

This film is a bit underrated and definitely not bad. I think it's underrated because apart from Jennifer Love-Hewitt this film doesn't have any big names; most of the actors in this aren't very well known. It's a big unfair how a film's popularity is based mainly by the actors who are in it. I've seen a lot worse films than this, ahem Love Actually. I don't know how Love Actually is one of the most popular romantic films out there when it's ridiculously cheesy and contrived. OK so the Truth About Love isn't an amazing film, the story has all been done before, but it's a fun watch.

Grade: C<>Adultery, lies, deception, sex and porn movies and that is just the lawyers having fun, so you can imagine what the rest of the actors are up to, or you can just watch. Bristol is a beautiful setting for a movie and is shown in some of the camera work. Music adds its own character to the event making this a simple film to watch with the odd giggle along the way. Revenge is a snip or two. Nibbles: Quick Tiramisu.<>Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) hatches a plan to become a sexy alter ego and test her husband's faithfulness by pretending to be a secret admirer.

  Review:
  
  [/b]I figured it out. An awesome Japanese anime team got a couple American five year-olds, a horny kid around thirteen, a script from a bum, and they made The Venus Wars. The only thing cool about this movie are the vehicle designs and the [i]idea[/i] of a colonized Venus. The acting of the characters, understand they are animated, is pretty bad. It's almost two hours long too. I would have given it a 6 if it just had ended around fifty minutes without the rest of the story.
  
  Pleh!  This could have been cool, but it's not.<>The Venus Wars is an well written, well-paced war movie with a personal and gritty atmosphere. A movie that harkens back to a simpler time, a time when Japanese animators didn't have the luxury of computer animation and cel-shading. It surprisingly features a solid English dub job (despite some throw-away parts), since it was released in a time when the infiltration of Japanese animation into American homes was still in its infancy. The Venus Wars doesn't succumb to the over the top style that some Japanese developed animation does, which gives it a believable feel, the feel that it could have also easily been adapted into a live action movie. It doesn't re-write the action genre, but it does it right.

Notes

- The Venus wars was aired in heavy rotation in the late 1990's on the Sci-Fi Channel, back when the Sci-Fi Channel actually aired things worth watching, like MST3K. Knowing the way the channel treated stuff like this, I could imagine heavy editing due to content and length.

- As far as I know the only DVD version of this movie available in North America is the non-anamorphic  ""US-Manga"" edition, released in 1998. I would love to see this movie given an updated release on DVD, or Blu-Ray.<>[url=""http://animeworld.com/reviews/venuswars.html""]http://animeworld.com/reviews/venuswars.html[/url]

 Some time in the not too distant future, mankind has colonized Venus. After terraforming the planet to make the temperatures bearable and the air breathable, settlers seeking a life better than that on Earth came. But, as with Earth, not everything goes as planned. Life on Venus is hard, and the people there pass the time on watching a violent sport that works like a cross between a motorbike race and football. Hiro is just another one of the players, but when a neighboring nation invades his home country, he and his teammates decide to do their best to help out the homeland. Meanwhile, a reporter visiting from Earth, Susan Sommers (no, just an in joke, she hasn't changed careers in the next century), is reporting on the war and hunting for a Pulitzer. But, war isn't as simple or clean as it first seems to either of them.

   One of the classics. Venus Wars is a feature length, and quality, film. This is a classic war story--we have a young hero (no pun intended) caught in the middle of a bad situation, desperate to get involved and doing his best to fight for his country and become a man. And, as a counterpoint, we have the detached reporter, thrust into the middle of battle and forced to become involved with people she realizes are more than just a story. Finally, we have the war itself, which is both a grand spectacle and unusually realistic, complete with generals pulling strings from afar and confusing motives for those on the front. There are a few downsides to it, mainly the fact that it has a relatively ""classic anime"" feel; that is, the heroics of some young main characters are played up, and there are a few over-simple characters. This was a bit at odds with the realism of most of the story, but all in all it worked well, the story is engrossing, and the characters are both believable and human.

   Technically, Venus Wars is extremely well done--all the more so if you consider how old it is. The animation is generally top notch, and the war sequences are absolutely stunning--smooth and very realistic. The art is also generally good, although the old-school character designs won't be to everyone's taste (they do, however, match the original comic quite well). Finally, the mechanical design and general look and feel of Venus are both original and realistic, and the weapons (for once) actually look like the real thing. The acting is also good, and even the dub is passable. There is also one technique used that is unique in anime (but not all animation), to my knowledge--in a couple of the driving sequences, the road and background is real film, with animation laid over it. The footage is very grainy, and in a sepia tone, and the effect generally works quite well--it produces a great ""hand held"" camera style.

   Overall, Venus Wars is a fine piece of classic anime, with a solid plot and characters supporting impressively detailed and realistic animation. A good war story, and a generally good movie, by any standard.

It includes Japanese and English stereo soundtracks, English subtitles, and an illustrated menu providing access to a scene index and short character profiles. The transfer is quite clean, although the Japanese audio is a little harsh (not surprising, considering that it's an older movie). One tip--if you like the song at the end, listen to it on the English soundtrack--it is still sung in Japanese, and the audio must be from a different source, because it sounds much better. And, as with all USM releases, there is no translation of the Japanese credits. The video comes packaged in a plastic clamshell case. [/td] [/tr] [/tbody] [/table]

""Interpol Connection"" was a relatively-unknown cop-fu film that used a mixed bag of drama, comedy, Heroic Bloodshed gunplay and martial arts, patched together like short stories from a documentary. Despite the flaws, the martial arts action, choreographed by legendary Wushu expert/action choreographer Dion Lam (The Matrix Trilogy, Black Mask, Exit Wounds, Spider-Man 2, The Promise), was the savior of this movie. Robin Shou and co-star, Japanese martial arts queen Yukari Oshima (Shanghai Express, Legendary Amazons) deliver some fight power. Robin has the strength of an athlete and the kicking power of a kickboxer while Yukari uses incredible speed & flexibility of an acrobat and weaponry of a Shaolin warrior. Director and veteran martial arts actor Phillip Ko Fei (also the film's main villain) has established himself as a prolific filmmaker in independent Taiwanese and Hong Kong productions but this one wasn't his best work. However, Dion Lam's choreography shined Robin and Oshima's diverse martial arts skills and the presentation of the fight sequences evolved a great quality to give fans something to watch without being too discouraged by the poor aspects of the film.",,,,,,,,

I love Will Ferrell. I haven't seen Julia Louis-Dreyfus for a long time, but loved her in Seinfield.

This movie was a one-trick pony and that pony got buried in an avalanche with nothing to dig the poor thing out. 

The tone was all over the place. The ski instructor scenes were pure B-grade comedy. The flippant way the movie ended also spoke of a comedy. But what happened during the avalanche was dead serious and life changing. 

No explanation was given for the father's decision. What led him to do that? And the way the mother reacted to it was understandable, but tedious to watch through a whole movie and at times she just seemed to go into hysterics (again, the tone was wrong). The way the boys reacted to their father was like no boys ever. It would have been forgotten and over with quickly and they would have wanted to get on with the business of being kids on a snow trip. If the director wanted to run it that way, they should have set the avalanche up better and bigger and made the event traumatic.

Am going to have to find the original movie it was based on and see how that one plays out.<>Hey Americans, STOP MAKING CURRENT REMAKES OF MASTERFUL FOREIGN FILMS!!!! Utter shite!<>Interesting setup and a few interesting interactions.  But first, this is NOT a comedy.  It is a depressing look at a failing marriage that takes a weird upturn in the last 2 minutes.  Will Farrell isn't an awful dramatic actor, but just awfully miscast here.  Many of the scenes are just cringe inducing - maybe fine for 'Kramer vs Kramer', but feels gross here.  The kids just play plot utilities, as well as much of the supporting cast.

Book plot better.<>6. The story of Belinda: When romance collides with career.

The sixth installment in the Hallmark's 'Love Comes Softly' movie series. I can't believe I have crossed the halfway mark with this in the series, yet a long way to go. I really enjoyed so far with many ups and lows. I am happy with this part compared to the previous two where the series hit the rock bottom. This film was much better and had a very nice storyline. Yet a few more new characters were introduced as the storytelling expanded to the next timeline.

I am just recalling the whole series very briefly to remind you that it all began with Marty and then moved later to her step-daughter, Missie. From this, the third generation story begins with Missie's step-daughter, Belinda. So the theme is getting little modern while proceeding in the each film in the series. Modern means that contrasts with the period of time when the story sets in. The story remains still in the cowboy culture and explores the various subjects.

""The only thing you have to rely
on this world is yourself.""

One of the best movie in the series that perfectly represents the title. Most importantly for the first time the story focuses other than the family issue. Well, there's romance as well, which is short and cute. The actual narration is Belinda's interest in taking up her career very seriously. For a late 19th century woman, even in the New World that was a challenging thing. So how everything goes is the entire movie.

Well, 'Love Comes Softly' and deaths in its all the films are not co-incident, but a customary, that's how I felt so far. Some of the deaths were very emotional and connected deeply with the main characters, those had a strong hold in the storytelling. But some were simply unnecessary, like in this one perhaps. Maybe it was a lesson, a turning point, or medicines were not advanced to save people from the deaths or 'to make realise its value/worth' kind of stuff. So I accept it in this, because it was not that bad, but the way it happened was so silly.

Besides the 'deaths', the loverboy is the other thing who comes from nowhere and steals the woman of the movie. I mean in a good way, but I don't know, maybe that is the way it was happening in those times. Like I mentioned earlier, it's flourishing towards the 20th century. Maybe the next movie would take place in the city, but have to wait and see. Because that is an exciting thing to see a city for the first time. I had a very good time with this, and believe the forthcoming films would be even better. So see you later...

7/10<>i love these movies!!!! They are so cute!!!!!!<>Nice feel-good movie.  Unbelievable how many ""good"" things can happen in one movie.<>This was not my favorite of the series.

Scout Taylor Compton was fantastic in this movie. One of her best performances ever! Very excellent movie. Highly recommended.<>Feminism is evident throughout the movie. If Belinda knew her Bible better, she would know that women are to be treated as the weaker vessel--with honor.  This movie makes men out to be rude and blind if they believe women should stay home and work, when the opposite is really true.  I sort of enjoyed some of the story, though (it was basically clean and interesting), but not one I'd recommend.<>Centers on Missy's adopted daughter Belinda Tyler as she follows her dream. Belinda wants to be a doctor, but this time period does not look kindly on women with careers, especially one in the medical field. But Belinda is a strong-minded woman and deeply wants a career as a doctor. She manages to prove her abilities while assisting the local doctor and caring for an old woman who recently experienced a stroke. Belinda nurses her back to health and helps her regain the use of her arm again. Belinda also meets the nephew of their deceased neighbor. Drew comes to town to get his uncle's farm in shape to sell. After that he intends on returning to New York to join his father's law practice. He has no desire to stay in this small, unsophisticated town. But after meeting Belinda he has second thoughts. Belinda also feels something for Drew, but she is conflicted because she wants to be a doctor. Even though the norm of the time is for a woman to get married and have children, Belinda wants more. She has a calling and a great mind for medicine.","Brian Gordon, Erik Olson",,,,TVPG,,,

And you don't even have to smell the tear gas.,"Berkeley in the Sixties is an amazing take on the origins of the Free Speech Movement and the rest of the Anti-Vietnam War protest in Berkeley. I love the documentary because of the footage, interviews from the people who were at Berekely, and the music. This documentary really shows light on the events that happened in Berkeley. Overall, Berkeley in the Sixties is a perfect documentary for history lovers.<>The students' rights movement, the anti-war movement, and the resulting riots are romanticized in this documentary.
It's hard to watch this film without recognizing what happened to the political energy of the sixties during the eighties.  Yuppie and Baby Boomer activists became soccer moms and hockey dads more concerned about soybean futures than what their former nemesis, Reagan, was doing to the country.  But the interviewees were carefully chosen: those who continued the plights of their youth are the only ones represented in the film.  What is more, the police and university administrators come off as universally deplorable, anti-democratic fascists; the police look more like storm troopers than cops.
All this is not to say that I didn't learn anything from the film or that it was bad, but it's certainly an agenda film, and the criticisms of its heroes are limited to not having a complete political agenda - a criticism that is light and venial.
Overall, I think this is a film for a specific audience, one that is comprised of people who wish to delight in the sixties no matter how myopic they look at the time.<>it was interesting i guess, good to watch in classes<>Nice recounting of the evolution (or devolution) of the Berkeley protest movement throughout the '60s.  Told from the points of view of those intimately involved as protestors, so don't expect a balanced treatment of the subject.

I like to think that I would have been among the Berekley political activists, as opposed to the drugged-out San Francisco hippies.<>This informative documentary has lots of original news footage, letting the Berkeley free speech advocates speak for themselves, both then, in B&W snippets, and again a quarter century later, in full color interviews.  (By the way, philosopher John Searle is among those interviewed.)<>I thought this was really well done. I like that it stays focused on the student movement while still dealing with the wider context, especially locally (the Panthers, the hippy counterculture, the rise of Reagan). Clearly coming from a left perspective, but not uncritical of the movement, the combination of archival footage and diverse interviews gives you both a sense of what it was like at the time and how it is understood in retrospect. If you have any interest in universities as sites of collective resistance, don't miss this.<>A very decent even if quite of an abridged abstract of this time in history. It gives a very general glimpse of how the movements of the 60's boomed... it lack more information I wish I could've seen in it, but the 60's and Berkley have a lot to offer, therefore I consider that this documentary should be watched and be complemented with other like documentaries in order to get a broader perspective of the times and how we have gotten to where we are and where we're going.

It is the most accessible film that Jodorowsky has made, yet he doesn't compromise his style or vision.<>With strong images the director manages to show the sensitive relationship between father and son [Full Review in Spanish]<>Easily Jodorowsky's most accessible movie. Though don't worry, this is still a Jodorowsky film, so you're bound to get things like a dwarf in a Hitler costume or an angel held aloft, surrounded by a sea of red-clad devils. Accessibility is a spectrum.<>The mix of vulgarity and spirituality, of affectionate freakshow and savage political theater, is pure Jodorowsky, and you can feel his restless invention swirling through every scene.<>The sheer artistry in just one frame of Endless Poetry is enough to send you into sensory overload.<>Alejandro Jodorowsky has created a surrealist autobiography that will certainly enrapture the fans of the filmmaker.<>Functions as an attempt at personal reconciliation with past experiences that can never be truly recreated... The director's latest shows the beginnings of a visionary growing fed up with structure and boundaries.<>Endless Poetry is constantly engaged in the act of invoking without ever evoking anything. In that sense, its name is just wrong; there's no poetry to it at all.<>Goofy, uneven, alternately outrageous and charming (when not both at once), Endless Poetry is as good an introduction to his work as any, and it couldn't have been made by anyone else.<>In its mix of the absurd and the beautiful, Endless Poetry puts into images the sweeping emotions of Jodorowsky's big, beating heart.<>It's not endless, but it can often seem insufferable.<>Endless Poetry isn't for every taste, but those who give it a try will find a celebration of imagination from a director whose sense of invention seems unchecked either by censorial impulse or personal inhibition.<>By the time Alejandro confronts his father...it occurs that self-indulgence is sort of the point and that it just might be in the service of something that is actually, simply profound. Jodorowsky is dramatizing his life, just like everybody else does.<>Watching it is a little like getting kidnapped by a troupe of mimes and puppeteers, but at some point Stockholm Syndrome sets in and you end up liking its utter insanity.<>Sustaining the mood, Jodorowsky once again bathes the feature in oddity, personal expression, and grotesqueries, making this second chapter as captivating as the first.<>Endless Poetry offers a ribald and revelatory road to poetic nirvana.<>Endless Poetry is not a movie that has any interest in hiding its metaphorical (or literal) erections.<>Though a little Jodorowsky goes a long way, Endless Poetry is the director's most accessible film to date. The story is linear and often funny, even if you're not initially sure if it's supposed to be.<>Drawing on that particular quality of light that seems unique to Chile, Jodorowsky paints an alluring portrait of his homeland.<>Jodorowsky is genuinely thoughtful and searching...","Being a big fan of Jodorowsky, I finally got to see this film after a few years of digging. It's a biography where his sons plays both him or other characters as this vivid story gives is an impression of how it was to be Alejandro, a hard working and inspiring poet in Chile. It perfectly makes no sense the same way it gives complete meaning. It's kind of typical Jodorowsky in it's way, but not that bizzarre or grotesque. Sure, there is some genitals - both of them, clowns, masks, naked midgets, father and son kissing, cake splatting and all of the things you expect, but there is little blood or other human fluids. Few animals as well.

It can be tricky to hang on to, but it does not demand your total focus the entire two hours, even if the amazing poetic words and frases comes so tight that you might loose a few if you look away. It develops nicely and it has a nice score. The camerwork is pretty darn neat too! The colorworks and set props are amazing and it's got that increcible ability to give all the weirdness some beauty. Just like only Jodorowsky can.

8.5 out of 10 purple boats.<>This is a semi-autobiographical story about the early part of the writer/director's life, before he got into film, when he was an aspiring poet. Unlike Holy Mountain, the other, much earlier film I've seen from him, this is both visually extraordinary and narratively coherent. Don't get me wrong. This tale is very far from normal. But it follows an understandable arc with characters who say things to each other that make sense. After all, it's at least partly a true story, one the author presumably knows very well. Anyway, if you aren't put off by European-style surrealist art movies, there's a good chance you will really love this. I did.<>Loved, loved, loved this quirky but beautifully done film. Alejandro passes on his life lessons to his audience and I feel honored to have received it!!<>Jodorowsky's singular imagination has not ceased even into his late 80s as evidenced by Endless Poetry, a film filled with beautiful color, lavish set pieces, and an strangely personal center.<>One of the best movies I have ever seen<>Una parte de la inocencia que le funcionaba muy bien a ""La danza de la realidad"" se perdió en este nuevo trabajo.<>For me the review of this movie is in it's title.
POESIA: this is pure poetry on film. Surreal, strong, shocking, sweet... well, everything, like only poetry can be. 
SIN FIN: if I have to find out a flow, I have to say that is a bit too long. Not really endless, it does finish eventually. I guess that even beauty, like everything else, can be too much sometimes.<>Totally weird but visually appealing. I guess it says something that we watched it to the end.<>You will never see a more whacked-out (or enjoyable) film of this sort...I can guarantee it! From the Chilean director who wrote the original script for Dune and was infamous early in his film career for El Topo & The Holy Mountain. This one is autobiographical as the artist is in his late eighties and many of the  characters in his Fassbinder-style troupe are played by his own sons & friends. What a Swan Song! Will Alejandro Jodorowsky have another gem of a film or two to bestow upon us during his late period? I surely hope so!<>Endless Poetry has it all: the beautiful picture, the craziness of the world of art, minor details that play a major role in the director's storytelling style, and hope. The film has as bright colours as diverse are the emotions it consists of. While you watch it, you see a lot of standard tricks: haircut, head-shaving, children's bicycle, ""Clockwork Orange""'s like penises on the walls and many others, funny enough, it's hard to say that the director gives them a different meaning. Nevertheless, they seem to fit well into the picture, along with awesome actors. The movie also breaks the fourth wall by introducing ""ninja-style"" characters that sometimes give the heroes the thing they need or moving a train-mockup. Which is hilarious and super fresh. The main thing I liked about the movie is that it left me hopeful; and looking at the crazy world around me, the voice inside wants to embrace whatever I have and ""change the world starting from myself, possibly leaving no bridges behind"".",Xavier Guerrero Yamamoto,"Jul 14, 2017 limited",$64.0K,ABKCO Films Inc.,,,,

So the new conclusion...crappy acting, annoying repeated Osmond song throughout the entire movie, cheesy storyline, made for a movie that had a happy ending albeit very very predictable one.

Zatoichi has few equals on the battlefield or in the gambling den. But the rival gang hires Miki Hirate (Shigeru Amachi), an equally skilled swordsman for whom Zatoichi has great respect.

Samurai fans may rejoice<>Though The Tale of Zatoichi features a few exciting action sequences, this is more of a moody character study than an outright karate flick.<><>serves as a good introduction to the character, establishing his major traits and offering a worthwhile narrative","While ""The Tale of Zatoichi"" went on to inspire and give life to a long series of films that sum up Zatoichi and his life and adventures, the film was a little slow at times as it had to develop and showcase the Zatoichi character to viewers for the first time. This isn't to say the film isn't worth a watch and has several truly exciting and stylish moments to witness throughout. I love samurai films and while this isn't at the top of the group, it is nevertheless a good film and very prevalent to Japan as it's become almost like the Japanese James Bond franchise. If you're into samurai films then this is a series of films worth checking out and delving into as the 26 films (25 of which are together for the first time on Criterion's spectacular Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman Blu-ray box set) tell one complete story of the legendary character. Of course there is the television series as well to take note of and should be viewed before watching the 26th and final film. Can't wait to continue onwards!<>This movie gives off those ‘The Sword of Doom' vibes that I cherish and love. It looks like it's got a good sense of humor as well. I feel like this saga of movies are going to play out similar to episodes of Samurai Champloo, where it's filed with excitement, kick ass sword fights and playful humor. I'm already captivated by it. Seeing the blind man deal the bets with all the guys. He's probably going to pull something clever out of his sleeve. He's probably luring them all in, baiting them all to put money down so that at the end, for the final deal, he can take all their money lol. What an amusing way to introduce a character - Zatoichi. A blind and humble masseur who has morals. I think they cast the actor that plays Zatoichi perfectly. I love how badass he is, and the best part is he doesn't flaunt it. He doesn't let anyone know how masterful he is with the sword until provoked. He keeps it a secret and stays humble. Ichi really is a force to be reckoned with. 

I love how Zatoichi meets the skilled swordsman, the same one the boss was talking about, just randomly while out fishing for carp at the lake. That was a clever little moment in which both of them got to know each other and sort of size each other up. We also get a glimpse into how powerful Ichi's senses are when it comes to feeling and sound. I also get the feeling that the swordsman from Edo doesn't really care whether or not he lives or dies. He seems to be pretty ill and his backstory tells us he lost everything back home in Edo, and that could be including his family if he had one. 

This movie has some very clever and genuinely funny moments that take you by surprise. Like when the clan is talking about Ichi and wondering if he is in fact a skilled swordsman, and then the camera zooms out quickly to reveal that he was there in the back the whole time. Lmao! That was comedy gold right there. The lighting is impeccable. Reminds me of Onibaba or Sword of Doom with how atmospheric it feels at times. That scene where Ichi is walking along the swamps with Otane and touches her face was so poetically pretty. The moon in the corner of the shot with the tree framing it was masterfully composed. 

Dude Ichi is an artist with his katana. Wielding his sword almost like a master painter creating brush strokes of death. The way he took out those two guys in the forest in less than 3 seconds was amazing. I like the way Hirate dies on Ichi's back/shoulder after he gets him with a backwards stab to the chest. Pretty poetic. They both respected each other and Hirate was ready to die. I'm glad Ichi really stuck to Sukegoro at the end there basically telling him to suck it. Throwing the money he gave him on the ground and then telling him how he shouldn't be celebrating their victory since many of their men died during the battle. While the clans only cared about winning against the other, Zatoichi and Hirate cared about a mutual respect and fair fight towards each other - honor. The only reason the clans started the battle with one another was for power and financial gain. Selfish needs. 

I think what I like most about these types of samurai movies like Lone Wolf & Cub, Sword of Doom, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai is how they sort of experiment and kind of disregard all the boring and lame traditional stuff you see in older samurai movies from the 50's. These are a lot more grittier, more stylish, more creative and a lot more fascinating -  and I love that. Really tight, controlled and beautiful cinematography. Zatoichi the blind swordsman, really is a force to be reckoned with. I really enjoyed and loved watching this movie - and I knew I'd love it even before watching it. I anticipate watching the other twenty four movies in the saga.<>First in a line of twenty-six(!) samurai movies about a blind master swordsman who roams the countryside, conning the con-men and dicing the wannabe tough guys. In this chapter, Zatoichi accepts the hospitality of a small-time yakuza boss and allows himself to be enlisted into a simmering turf war. He finds a kindred spirit in an opposing ronin, a fellow pawn in the schemes of others, and mourns that their fates seem destined to converge in a duel.

The Tale of Zatoichi contains very little action, only a few lightning-fast demonstrations before the big battle at the end, but that restraint is careful and deliberate. In lieu of bloodier material, we learn to appreciate Ichi's meditative nature, recognize the shades of grey in his surroundings, enjoy the scenery of a small feudal village and anticipate the inevitability of the moment he finally bares his blade. Shintaro Katsu is calm and confident in that leading role, carrying himself with composed dignity while also selling the gravity of his handicap. As the supporting cast makes light of his condition and underestimates his capabilities, we observe his keener senses of hearing and smell, aides which he keeps to himself, and note the quiet stock he takes of everyone milling about.

At heart, this is a straightforward example of the genre. It hits many of the same notes you'll see in its contemporaries - strict code of honor, cynical worldview, reluctant violence, understated emotions - but it does these things well and is old enough that it could probably be credited with popularizing a few of them. I'm looking forward to watching this character develop.<>This film was solid.<>Zatoichi, where have you been all my life?<>Suitably saving on the action to accentuate the deadliness of the hero, this is a great samurai film (albeit with dated fighting scenes) that comes with a solid moral center.<>Now that I am finished with James Bond I will start my way through the Zatoichi boxed set but I have no interest in maintaining as strict a time table here. Tales, the first film, was good. At times it is beautiful. Shintaro Katsu is spectacular as the title character, a blind swordsman. The first movie is somewhat formulaic of an Asian period film so my mind wandered several times. Two yakuza bosses hire swordsmen to help them to overthrow the other. The swordsmen befriend each other and are forced to duel when the war between clans erupt. I am interested to see how the next 22 films are and when they start to slag.<>First out of 25 Zatoichi features. This blind masseur with extraordinary swordskill and a hearing detailed as fuck. Charming and justice seems to be his key elements. Strikingly good.<>The Tale of Zatoichi is a great introduction fo the character of Ichi or Zatoichi. It shows the audience his skill, his mind set, gives some backstory, and gives a good overall impression of the man that is the blind swordsman.
The film is rather old so it's not surprising that many of the scenes are shot more like they are part of a stage play rather than a film set and the action sequences aren't very plentiful nor very convincing. 
Where this film truly shines is in the story being told. Two gangs, two master swordsman, truly dispicable yakuza members, a love struck beauty, gambling, all combine to form the backbone of a tale of honour and code versus greed and selfishness.
There are many messages and morals one can take away from The Tale of Zatoichi. The blind swordsman is true to his word, a master without sight, knowledgeable, kind, honest, desired and yet feared at the same time.

It's actually so bad it's funny.<>While I admire the effort put into this by writer/director/star Cavanah, it's unintentionally hilarious portrayal of pimps and hos just doesn't cut the mustard. Cavanah's mixture of stagey interiors, vaudevillian villains and unemployed Eastenders tries hard to be tough and sleazy but ends up notable only for an unbelievably OTT ''performance' from chavstar Danny Dyer as the King of Soho (lol). Screenplay-wise, Cavanah obviously thought no-one else had seen Man Bites Dog before embarking on his weedy mockumentary but, by casting instantly recognisable faces alongside real West London types, the fourth wall he hoped to penetrate remains resolutely undisturbed. Despite all the negatives, Cavanah himself is a force to be reckoned with and his portrayal of Woody the pimp is sensitive and restrained. The rest is wannabe cor-blimey bollocks and, despite its title, relatively free of the sort of sordid shocks the producers of this garbage sought to tempt us in with. Shabby (but not in a good way), I'm still looking forward to the director's next stab. Half a star for West London locations.",,,,,,,,

For starters, Kharis and his beloved awaken in Cajun country. Never mind that they were last seen being swallowed by a swamp in New England. And if they were afraid that you'd forget this takes place in a Cajun setting, they were thoughtful enough to give us a character named Cajun Joe. He pals around with characters named Goobie and Achilles, by the way. This is inspired. Moving on. They also recycle a lot of footage from past Mummy flicks. The last two did the same, but not to this extent. On the plus side, Chaney does reasonably well once more, while never coming close to Karloff's level. The Mummy sequels were more fun than I was anticipating. It's a shame that they bottomed out towards the end like this.<>Lon Chaney Jr. put on the bandages one last time for yet another bland Mummy movie. This one inexplicably moves the setting from New England to Louisiana and, if the conflicting timelines of the older movies can be believed, takes place in 1995. It surrounds a hapless crew of workmen and archaeologists who are draining the swamp that entrapped the mummy in the last film. The Mummy's Curse regurgitates the plot points of its immediate predecessors while helping itself to plenty of stock footage from the very same forebears.

David Niven is fun but peter sellers is better in everyday. A funny finale with a odd ending why did it end this way. I had fun alot of fun champagne in bed, great gag.<>Still laughable creative comedy.<>This is a mildly amusing film - the first in a long series of films, such as 'Revenge of the Pink  Panther' etc. Inspector Clouseau doesn't feature as much in this first/initial film and the film is less action oriented, with most scenes taking place in a bedroom (hotel room?), with Sir Charles Lytton (played by David Niven) schmoozing a young lady. It did feel a little bland to start with, although it became more amusing in the 2nd half, when there's a costume party and some of the more comic, farcical type comedy/plot elements come out. It certainly takes a somewhat more surreal turn and I can't say I wasn't entertained by then but the first half I didn't find especially engrossing, although what I can say is that I liked how the female characters were able, on ocassion, to stick up for themselves and issued some fairly decent put downs to the somewhat lecherous male characters - good for you!. Oh and it almost goes without saying that it features the iconic, animated comic-type title sequence with the titular cat, who went on to have his /(her?) own spin off animated cartoon show. I also recognised John Le Mesurier present in one of the final scenes - whenever I see him, I think of Dad's Army (British WWII based sitcom) of course!.

I liked the madcap feel to the final few scenes of this film and I'd recommend the film to fans of David Niven, Peter Sellers, fans of the Pink Panther franchise obviously and farcical comedy film fans in general I suppose. Oh and also, finally, there's a nice scene or two showing cars rushing about in a chase, although we dont witness the full chase itself but I thought it was fun to see the old cars whizzing by regardless.<>👍 Peter Sallers as Inspector Clouseau

👎 cheesy and stereotypical rich/noble characters
👎 a boring and tensionless plot<>A wonderful film that has just the right amount of slapstick matched with a lot of class.  David Niven is superb.  Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous.  In fact everyone in this is excellent.  Mancini's music can't be topped.<>The Pink Panther gets off to a SLOW, boring start and it can be surprising to learn that, despite Peter Sellers stealing the show, Inspector Clouseau is not the protagonist and only becomes more prominent in the third act. However, once this caper flick starts becoming more properly dedicated to slapstick, it becomes a funny comedy with great physical performances, reflexes and comedic timing. The score is definitely no slouch either and the animated opening credits sequence is quite amusing, despite the more popular cartoon character's different design and him being on the receiving end of the amusing injuries rather than Clouseau. Long story short, The Pink Panther is an above-average comedy that just happens to have the glaring flaws of being outdated and having a boring first act. Good to know the sequels all keep the focus on the true star Inspector Clouseau.<>""You only live once, so watch the Pink Panther twice""... Apart from the magnificent theme by Henri Mancini, this comedy is to be considered a masterpiece of the motion picture industry! Highly entertaining with a great international cast and picturesque scenarios. Must see! My rating: 9/10<>Wasn't sure at the beginning as to how funny it would be (though the music, which I'll never get tired of, had me hooked from the start) but this turned out to be an absolute hoot and when it wasn't hilarious it was charming and a highly enjoyable time. The direction, screenplay and pacing were surprisingly sharp especially for the period. The gags never fell through because the timing, blocking and performances especially were just spot on. Each actor looked like a typically stuffy kind of 60's actor but each one just puts the wackiness and energy up to 11. David Neven especially looked like a sophisticated and aloof thespian type but he got into the physical humor which I loved. There was one who naturally stood out above the rest though. I didn't see just how funny Peter Sellars could be in Dr. Strangelove but in this movie he shines above and beyond what I expected. Each little stumble he did, every corner tripped on, the mustache touch, the hands in the porridge, even the pratt falls he did off screen were perfectly hilarious. Some scenes that really stood out that so easily couldn't have worked and not been funny were the bedroom scene (a single scene going that long couldn't keep someone's attention, could it? Yes, yes it could) The car chase scene, which had the stroke of genius of just adding that one old guy to stone-facedly behold the mayhem which gave that extra push of intelligently executed shenanigans that make this movie stand out and especially the final heist which was bonkers beyond anything I was anticipating. The movie is like a typical heist/sleuth kind of film and that element provides a plot and structure and then the film puts on a generous helping of tongue in cheek to add the spice that makes this movie so memorable. It was really great to see such a farce of a heist film where the thieves get away with it even though they never successfully completed a heist in the first place (Gorilla costumes man, 10/10)!  A really good time. This movie just has it right. You could watch for the music and the opening titles alone but stick around and see the rest, you'll love it.<>Surprisingly entertaining and hilarious decades later, The Pink Panther is truly a timeless classic.<>Definitely a must-see, if for no other reason than Peter Sellers stellar performance as Inspector Clouseau. I know most people say the sequels are superior because they focus more on him. I am among the few who prefer his performance in THIS movie. Inspector Clouseau wasn't a comedy icon yet, so the filmmakers were discovering Sellers' talents as the filming went along. You hear about actors ""stealing the show"" a lot but here is perhaps one of the best examples of an actor doing just that. Yet, while a ""bumbling detective,"" he is not entirely stupid. He's at least smart enough in this film to KNOW when he's making a fool of himself. That embarrassed reaction to his own bumbles makes it all the funnier. Additionally, the location (Cortina, Italy) is absolutely beautiful and helps create the perfect atmosphere. It's the kind of movie that would be fun to watch from under a blanket, sitting by a fireplace. Warm and cozy! I just love it.",Martin Jurow,"Mar 20, 1964 wide",,United Artists,,,,

It doesn't have to be the right thing, only the thing to do right now.<>The film maintains a hypnotic mood that builds to an effective moral quandary.<>The story is too familiar to be truly shocking, but there are plenty of surprises in store, even as the inexpensive, mildly same-y taste of advent calendar chocolate (you know the type) begins to lose its novelty.<>This is middling festive horror fare, neither too naughty to truly shock nor too nice to fully win us over.<>It won't be a holiday classic, but it is a welcome addition to the holiday horror canon.<>It's entertaining and stylish enough to ignore the mounting inconsistencies.<>The Advent Calendar is a sneaky and suspenseful thriller that bobs and weaves through moments of spookiness, gore, and contemplation.

Altough I would expect it as a Shudder movie to be budget restricted, but it looks and sounds good. I recommend.<>I enjoyed the film and I would recommend any one what this movie!<>Really good suspense movie. Reminded me of best Japanese movies of same genre.<>The Advent Calendar is a spine-tingling thriller with a gripping storyline and rapid development, that leaves a place for thought. 
The story revolves around Eva (Eugénie Derouand), a dancer who became paraplegic after the car accident. Good acting and cracking dialogues makes Eva's emotions feel real. She's not morally white, like any human.
The mystic side makes viewers make various assumptions, and it's exhilarating. A proper combination of lighting, sounds, and colors adds to the atmosphere.  
This film tackles such issues as living in our society with a disability, family, friends, and hard choices. As for me, the way it's displayed is controversial. I wouldn't call the movie very progressive, but it leaves a lot of place for insight.
I recommend it as a good movie choice for a night with friends with a good talk after.<>With interesting premises, what starts as basic horror ends up being a pretty enjoyable if not scary full of thrills ride of a holiday movie sticking to its calendar. There are some genuine ideas and the movie is visually solid. The main actress is invested and effective and you get some clever spins on the day by day horrifying surprises out of the calendar's boxes. The only dowpoint might be the scene with the demon at the river that looks like taken from a different b-movie but overall certainly not revolutionary but still really enjoyable.<>It suffers a little when ""ich"" comes out of the box, but otherwise it's a big brew of treats each day of the month. If she wants to get her dancing abilities back, Eva has some serious decisions to make.<>Don’t think of it as a horror film or alternative Christmas movie and you’ll enjoy. I never had the problem of guessing every single turn and to me that is gold. It’s more mysterious and spooky than jump out of your couch scary but I really loved the dark ride and enjoyed the treat behind every door. Score is slightly heavy handed but everything else is top shelf. Insanely immersed acting, sweet revenge scenes, believable dream logic to it all. Great none of the above Shudder pic if you’re sick of the old slasher in the woods trope etc <>A unique a somewhat minimalist premise, this is an interesting take on the Christmas horror story. It's an effective and intriguing thriller where I didn't know where it was going, and had an interesting sense of ""what would you do?"" that built to a climax that's the ultimate knife twist that really stuck with me. It's not perfect, with some pacing troubles and moments that are more silly than scary, but it's definitely more interesting than most horror films I've seen recently.","Virginie Ogouz, Alain Benguigui",,,,,,,

Claire Trevor plays the love interest.<>Columbia's first Technicolor western is a beaut--The color is impressive , good story, good action!!<>Very formula Western benefits a little from a good cast.<>If it's got Scott and Ford ... it can't be bad.<>Early technicolor Western. Fine cast but not especially noteworthy otherwise.<>Run of the mill western with a good cast. Some of Claire Trevor's costumes are eyepoppingly over the top. That she can carry them off says a great deal about her class and magnetism. Scott on the other hand whether through his playing of it or the role itself practially evaporates from the screen. Some of the scenes of the open range are fine but then stuck right in the middle are obvious rear projection shots which take you right out of the picture.<>Good 40's western with two stalwarts of the genre in Scott and Ford. Crooked double-dealing and gun-play in one of the very first technicolor movies.<>It's another regular crooked tale of the west with top bill actors, and a nice piece of movie history being Columbia's first technicolor film.<>Fairly perfect for a western. Of course, with Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, it couldn't really be bad.<>Totally cute, happy western.

It suffers here and there, but man it is not the worst thing I've ever seen.

What brings this movie truly into gold status is either the meme comments, or the people not understanding Christian Bale is not in the movie. On the one hand, it's hilarious to think about that many people mistaking Slater for Bale, on the other, I really hope it's a community joke I'm just not privy to.<>Play back is not a good horror film. The film barely has any scares in the acting is pretty bad. Christian Slater despite getting top billing is only in the film may be 15 minutes. It’s a repetitive film that tries to introduce scares but fails. The movies watchable is just not very good in anyway.<>The sloppy film making and awful acting are ultimately what makes this motion picture almost unbearable to watch.<>This is not what one would call a horror classic, to say the least.  It's not even what one would call a mediocre horror film.  It's, for all intents and purposes, a largely terrible horror film with a somewhat decent idea that it absolutely wasted.  To be fair, even if the idea itself had been executed well, let's say a 6 out of 10 in its effectiveness, I don't think the film would've been very good anyway.  It's just that everything around it, from the cast, the cinematography, the writing, everything was really working against this film.  Let's not kid ourselves, Christian Slater was in this film simply for a paycheck and for the fact that his 'name value' could probably secure some funding for the film.  It's very clear that he's there for those reasons and his character, while important in moving the ""narrative"" forward, isn't exactly necessary.  The gore is pretty terrible as well to be honest.  It just looks very cheap and B-movie-esque.  Not saying that this movie was meant to be taken all that seriously, but there aren't a lot of hints of irony coming from this film, so that's a shame.  The acting is pretty much what you can expect from such a low-budget horror film, not very good.  It's not that there aren't some marginally talented people in the cast, it's just that the way their performances were directed/edited did absolutely nobody any favors.  Nobody's stock improved from appearing in this film, not that it probably would've even if the film WAS good.  That's how respected horror films are in mainstream Hollywood, even though it's probably got the most loyal fans of any genre, who are easy to get money out of, apparently.  I did like the idea of this man, Harlan's great-grandfather, trying to possess the spirit of his relatives through the use of his films.  That's about the only thing I like, that concept, because the execution is stereotypical slasher.  I'm not even sure why I gave it one star.  It's not like it's the worst horror film I've ever seen, so that's probably part of it.  It's still a terrible horror movie and one that I regret watching.  Not recommended, obviously.<>This movie was HORRIBLE!! I couldn't even watch it all.. It was so boring that I kept losing interest every 3 mins<>steta,dobra ideja ima,ama pri kraj preoga vo predvidliv shablon,i sve se uriva :(<>Not even Christian Slater nor a bevy of beauties in voyeuristic situations can save this one.  On the surface, Playback is generally enjoyable. The premise is pretty standard for the most part and the kills are decent. Where this film goes off the tracks is first with a found footage thing being mixed into the ""normal"" footage and having a sort of bizarre Shocker, meets The Ring, meets Ghost in the Machine, meets Taking Lives thing going on.  Had the film concentrated on doing a better job of the killer being able to manipulate electronics or removed it completely, Playback could have played as a decent predictable slasher type flick.  As it is, it's a messy messy mix of too many characters, too many ideas, and too many wasted minutes of my life. Almost say the film felt like a really bad episode of the X-Files but lacked Scully and/or Mulder to at least make you want to keep watching.<>I suppose there was some sort of commentary on voyeurism in the original concept, but in the end it seems the final concept is ""you're watching this so you've just wasted a bunch of time.""<>Nickels misses the mark with this design of voyeurism and possession, unable to launch his idea with an inspiring sense of madness or even basic boogeyman clarity.<>I think the preview show more scary things than the movie itself.

It's perfectly silly and wonderfully overdone just like some of the campy original hits of this genre and you'll find yourself smiling throughout.<>80's nostalgia is real and has come alive in this unique horror film. Some fun VFX add to the enjoyment of this comedic romp into the horror genre.<>Distiller is an indie horror film where a horde of angry spirits stored in liquor bottles was released on a fourth of July party. The spirits were captured in the bottles by Blue Moon's uncle who was a ghost hunter. He disappeared and left her the house. The film has an interesting plot thatsets it apart from the recent horror flicks. We needed a break from the same old scare tactics with CGI, unnecessary gore and lousy jump scares. Distiller manages to make this horror film enjoyable with its reminiscence of the horror films of the 80s and the 90s. Furthermore, many people found it similar to the tone of Ghostbusters, Gremlins and the Evil Dead including myself. Although, it is a low budget film it had good practical and visual effects. But the film falls short on the audio mixing which could have been improved. The characters with their campy acting and tacky special effects from time to time which made it fun to watch. Therefore, the film is not to be taken seriously if you want to enjoy it. Distiller may not be a great horror film but it manages to keep you entertained.<>It's one of those indies that if you can relax your how gloss, super budget film habits...maybe a beer...maybe get your 420 glow...it's all gonna be just fine. There is some clever quips and that sorta Ghostbuster glow to it. I adore the spirit trapping power of booze bottle horn blowing to capture the mean spirits! Where storage of the evil after lifers is more profitable than capturing them! It's indie indie so if you are to enjoy a flick where you don't know the actors and enjoy the charm and simplicity of low budget visual effects...jump in. My friend calls it a two beer, two shot or two puff kinda flick. Sounds good to me.<>What a great watch! I thought it was so entertaining. It sends you back to the golden age of monsters movies by masters such as John Carpenter or David Cronenberg! Well done!<>A ghost hunter who ""distills"" his prizes begrudgingly travels the world until suddenly things go awry. His niece inherits her uncle's collection, and -- well, you will have to see the rest to find out.

Distiller is one of those movies you are not sure about in the beginning, but get sucked in bit by bit because of the tone. It's reminiscent of your favorite 80's type horror movies, but with a fun, low budget sensibility. I even dare say Evil Dead (the first one) feeling sometimes.  It reminded me of my high school summers with my friends when we had a stack of tapes to watch for the day. The special effects fit the movie perfectly and make Distiller a campy, different, and a welcome distraction. During this shelter-in-place, it's precisely just what the doctor ordered.<>I really enjoy films like this. It is the right level of camp and comedy. The horror elements were really well done and I was laughing throughout. If you want a solid film that doesn't take itself too seriously and will keep you entertained definitely check Distiller out.<>This is a really fun indie horror movie with Ghostbusters vibes. I love the concept of ghosts being trapped in bottles of alcohol (spirits, get it?). The sound design created some good suspense and the film was thoroughly entertaining throughout.

H. H. Holmes: Original Evil,,4,0 Reviews,Fewer than 50 Ratings,,spilled,,,Christian Bale,,"Sep 18, 2018",,,"Unknown Actor, Christian Bale",Không có review của nhà phê bình,"This was absolute garbage. The score was annoying. The narrator's voice boring & annoying. The piece was uninspired & uninteresting. I am asking myself how did this end up on Hulu? I have seen better executions of the subject on YouTube. This is embarrassing. I couldn't make it past 15 minutes. Who the hell is responsible for this POS?<>WHAT... DID... I... JUST... WATCH!?

I can't believe I am here, but I created a Rotten Tomatoes account to write a review specifically for this atrocious 'documentary'. I was hoodwinked into watching this absolutely garbage documentary! I love true crime documentaries and docu-series, but I'm honestly not exactly sure what I just watched for a torturous 1 hour and 5 minutes. 

Maybe I'm missing some inside joke between Hulu executives. Was this unnerving high school film project part of the fine print in some contract that Hulu signed before reading all the way through? 

Honestly, there are far too many issues with the film, so I'm going to try to word this review as positively as possible. So, if you like any of the following characteristics in a documentary film, you might want to give this a watch (but seriously don't waste your time):

-An awkward and unanimated narrator who pauses uncomfortably every few sentences.
-A boring script that's informational but presents nothing new on H.H.Holmes
-A non-linear timeline in a non-indie film
-Random stock footage of torture porn, old films/flickers, and some relevant photographs/drawings of H.H.Holmes and his victims that repeat over and over as if you didn't notice that the footage and actors have been used previously 
-Nude and busty CGI women, creepy CGI men in all sorts of outfits, and a CGI amusement park 
-Film shows modern toilets and flappers in a 19th century setting that also includes about 10 minutes of terribly cut black and white horse-buggy and trolly footage and nearly nothing on the Chicago World Fair 
-Graphic photographs of mutilated women that seem inappropriate given that they are of victims who probably didn't consent to this type of privacy violation
-An unnecessary and confusing Jack the Ripper side plot
-Repetitive information on facts vs. rumors on H.H.Holmes
-Very distracting background music that literally sounds like it's from a Sims video game
-No expert testimonies or historians to share their own facts or knowledge 
-The narrator says 'Chinese whispers' instead of 'telephone', 'gossip', 'rumors', or literally any other synonym 2017/2018
-Yes, that's right... this was made 3-4 years ago and not in late 1998<>I couldn't convince myself to finish watching it. H.H. Holmes may indeed live through this film through the psychological torture and death by boredom.<>I wouldn't even call this a movie, it's a podcast or audiobook with TERRIBLE pictures that have nothing to do with HH Holmes, I kept watching hoping I could give it at least something good... nope. That's 65 minutes of my life I will never get back. Netflix and every streaming service should ditch this junk fast!<>What did I just watch? How was this even produced? It seems as though the ""narrator"" simply read the Wikipedia page on the subject aloud to a montage of unrelated images, bad computer animations, and inappropriate, random music. For some reason he also pauses for about 10 seconds after most sentences. I feel like I know less about H.H. Holmes after watching this. If it pops up in your Hulu recommendations, give it a hard pass.<>The worst thing I have ever watched. Random, unrelated and repetitive stock footage with a poorly-written narration that doesn't actually reveal anything new or interesting about the serial killer. Absolutely horrible, don't bother.<>This documentary was inspirational. It proved to me that I, too, could make a documentary in my spare time. With an hour's worth of stock footage, some totally unnecessary, cutting-room-floor quality torture footage, and a few Saturday afternoons, I am confident that I could cobble together a documentary of this quality as well. Hulu, here I come!<>The clips of people suffering/dying had absolutely zero relevance to what the narrator was talking about. Absolutely none. Therefore, I'm calling it: I am entirely convinced that this was a snuff film. I think the entire H. H. Holmes plot was contrived as a vehicle to release torture porn in a semi-legit way.<>HH Holmes was notorious for torturing is victims. If he were alive today, I'm confident this documentary would be a main part of his process.
Quite possibly the worst documentary in the history of spoken word. Wow! Was it bad.<>If you want to watch a poorly made Prezi, take a look. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and just read Wikipedia.",,,,,,,,

The acting is above average with Thomas Inn Nicholas being half decent for child acting & Gary Busey being the best performance. The supporting cast is all either generic or over the top comedic delivery that is too cheesy. The cinematography & editing is all decent with nothing being incredibly shot but nothing really feeling out of place but nothing stands out really either. The pacing is uneven with the first part of the movie feeling very uneven at times because of hit or miss humor and the lack of Busey in the beginning making the acting very uneven also. The middle part of the movie is the best part with the story, acting and pacing all picking up momentum and having even some good charm which really surprised me. however the two biggest problems with the film besides it doesn't do anything spectacular technical wise is the ending is very predictable and and filled with jokes that didn't land at all which really killed the momentum for me and left me disappointed. The jokes throughout the rest of the film 90% of the time miss and fall flat. There not bad or cringe worthy its just they don't land at all and really kills the momentum of the film much of the time.

It's just average and isn't really worth your time unless your a real hardcore sports movie fan. Skip It otherwise.<>I am 13 and I absolutely loved this movie!

I had this on VHS as a kid and I used to watch it every single day until the tape met with a mysterious accident. Maybe grown-ups don't get it, but the kid in me will always love this movie. 

If you attempt to view this movie with a critic's eye, you might not see that this film was literally made for kids. This isn't the time to critique the plot flow, try to find depth in the acting performances, or whatever else. It's a movie for kids! 

If you can find your inner child, it's a great watch. 

I can hum the entire score!<>This movie honestly helped make me a baseball fan, and honestly I still enjoy it to this day.<>A quintessential 90's sports film with an absolute ridiculous premise that growing up you only could dream happen to you.

I was one of those kids, & I used to LOVE this movie; unfortunately, that love stayed back with that decade.

Within the first ten minutes of the film I was ready to turn it off and return it, but I wanted to get my money's worth and be able to write such a lovely review. The whole film is filled with terrible acting, terrible outfits, outlandish situations and impossible personalities. The movie follows a group of rebellious teens from well-to-do families. The jest of the film is: The girls are rich and foolish. The girls decide to rebel against the rules. The girls get in trouble with the law. The girls learn their lesson. The end.

FUN is the word that is emphasized in Singh Is Bliing, the film doesn't have a serious note in it. SIB is 2hrs and 30 mins of just laughter, and enjoyment. Even the most serious scene has a comic flair.The deadly combo of Akshay Kumar and Prabhu Deva is back after the success of Rowdy Rathore. But unlike RR, SIB is a masala entertainer, where comedy is has been given importance, and action is just a under current(RR was the opposite). However Id just like to state to all that Singh Is Bliing is not a sequel to Singh Is Kiing. Prabhu Deva makes a comeback of sorts with SIB after that disastrous Action Jackson, and he has redeemed himself with SIB. But mostly thanks to Akshay Kumar, who shoulders the whole film on his back, and he is in amazing form, he is just so entertaining to watch on screen. The underlining messages of SIB is what makes film above average,those of women empowerment (they should learn self defence), that a Singh always respects his parents, that he always helps the needy and that however the circumstances he always protects his honour. In short Singh Is Bliing is a simple, yet a very masaladar entertainer that the whole family can watch, and laugh there heart out. 

Story wise the film is about a Sardaar named Raftaar Singh who lives in a village in Punjab. Raftaar's parents especially his dad is feed up with his happy go lucky life, where he just fools around and does nothing. Raftaar's dad knows his son is of good character, and has a heart of gold, but he wants him to mature up. Therefore he sends Raftaar (with his two best friends)to Goa to work for his friend (also a Sadaar). Running parallel is the story of a girl named Sarah who leaves Romania to go to Goa after her dad who is a arms dealer is worried about her safety from a goon named Mark, who is after her. Raftaar therefore is given the job of taking care of Sarah while she is in Goa but she understands no Hind and he doesn't understand english. What ensues after that is a comedy of errors between both of them, and how they fall in love, and the repercussions form the rest of the plot.

Acting wise Akshay Kumar is back, and his Singhgiri is the best. Watching him in his comic flair is just too entertaining, and the way he shoulders the whole film on his back, is just outstanding. Amy Jackson I must say is a revelation in SIB, the way she pulls of action is just superb. Lara Dutta is a laugh riot on screen as Emily, her sleepwalking scene is one of the best scenes in the film. KK menon is good.Both of Akshay's friends Anil and Arfi are superb. Yoraj Singh and Rati are also
apt.

With a film like SIB, the negative points are those that plague most masala entertainers. The film is mindless at times, and the film has no real proper story, its rely's more on different situational comedy tracks. Also there is stereotypical villain etc.But I must say compared to Welcome Back ( a recently released masala entertainer) this film is eons better, in every which way, its not as logic less as WB. But at the end of the day its a Prabhu Deva film and if you have entered the cinema hall knowing this,you get what you expect. He is no Raju Hirani. Therefore Singh Is Bliing works because its a laugh riot from the first frame to last, the film never has a dull moment. The songs are superb, the production vaules are top notch, and most importantly the hero Akshay Kumar is at his best. The climax action scene gave me goosebumps and is superb also.And I must add that Punjab has never looked so beautifully and colorful in any film before.

Overall SIB is a family entertainer, that the whole family will enjoy. It makes no qualms about what it is, and if your a fan of funny masala entertainers then rush to the theatres, because the movies singh is blinging all over the screen.

The Bushes are shitty, but for other reasons, including war crimes and stealing elections.  Hang them over than!<>The most compelling movie showing a coup d'etat perpetuated by the Bush family.
A movie that will change America and possibly give it back to the US People, instead of the CIA of Bush.<>I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist however; I've always believed there was a secret U.S. Government group that carried the assassination and subsequent acts of the cover up of it.  Even the Congress, under the auspices of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978, stated that there was scientific evidence that JFK ""was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy"".   This documentary shows so many authenticated circumstantial links between powerful people in our government at the time, that I honestly believe that any jury in the U.S. would convict George H.W. Bush of ""Conspiracy to Assassinate the President"".  This is absolutely damning information.  I've watched this twice now because I have always liked former President George H.W. ""Poppy"" Bush however; doing my own research on the Internet, I've come to the conclusion that President Bush-41 was definitely a CIA operative in 1963, as J.Edgar Hoover states in a letter in late 1963. Bush was in Dallas on November 22nd and that he made a call to the FBI within two hours of the assassination, telling them to look at someone else who he had heard discussing his plan to kill JFK however; Bush doesn't remember making the call that day or where he was at that day.  Come on, everyone I know who was old enough to understand what happened that day can tell me where they were AND what they were doing.  This is damning enough.  Nixon was in Dallas that day but has given different details of what he experienced after the murder.  I wish I hadn't watched this because now, ""Poppy"" Bush has been tarnished to me forever.<>Filmmaker's pedantic, obnoxious narration makes this film unwatchable; the content and the ridiculous animations make it laughable.  The man's schizophrenic ""thought process"" can be described as one long non sequitur consisting of one dramatic leap of faith after another.  I want that time back.<>What happens when a tight documentary meets a procedural that employs the rigors of courtroom evidence as facts? Dark Legacy is the result of such work. Once viewed, the film leaves an indelible imprint on the viewer. Dark Legacy is as explosive as it is damning. 

It is obvious the director of the film intends the viewer to be any hypothetical potential juror in a court case, regardless of the defense employed by the defendant. The opening argument, testimony and evidence and then finally the closing arguments are deftly presented in a very engaging manner; brutally direct when necessary and almost cartoon-like parody in nature elsewhere.

The film speaks for itself. It is a masterpiece of free speech and cinema. In a way, its subject matter is far more horrendous than the most horrible art film. Dark Legacy posits a simple idea: Treason and High Crimes and Misdemeanors were committed by a future Oval Office Executive.","Paula Carter, David Lynn, Kristine Lynn",,,,,,,

The survivors are attracted to a building that is playing music where they meet other survivors. The show is then centered around the decisions that would be made by survivors  in this very situation, I would say this part of the movie was very well done. One aspect of the movie is we the audience get to see how people evolve from corpses to zombies and how the survivors react to each stage that the zombie evolves.

Full review here: http://canarymoviereviews.blogspot.com/2015/03/uzumasa-limelight.html<>This is one of the best Japanese movie in 2014.

This story is about a Japanese sumurai actor, Unknown hero, Kamiyama.

Kamiyama , Kami chan is an old extra who specialized in Japanese samurai&Ninja movie.His role was always some extra who was killed by famous and popular actors.He retired and happened to have a chance to play as a supporting actor with one of the most popular actor in Japan.

I really liked Mr.Fukumto who played Kami chan, Kamiyama. I guess that this was the first time for him to play such an important role.He had been an extra.I was really impressed on his act.It seemed that he fought against some age discrimination. Some time people don't respect elderly.Of course, it is hard for the old men to learn new things. But they have a lot of experience. Kami chan showed his spirit of the old man.

I really like the last scene. Kami chan played with one of the popular actor in Japan.Kami chan was killed. But I saw some happiness in his face.I believed he was satisfied with his play and happy to retire.<>Seizo Fukumoto, ""Japan's Most-Killed Samurai"" (http://bit.ly/1oHiDkM) (http://youtu.be/-4CEZj32xSI), finally gets his first starring role - and he's delightful. The movie falls into formula pretty regularly, but the look behind the scenes of a Japanese studio and, more especially, into the world of kirareyaku, the actors who specialize in dying on screen, is kept me rapt and delighted throughout. There's some really good looking cinematography and choreography, too.<>I absolutely loved this film. It was definitely one of the best Japanese movie that I have seen in recent years. It is a tribute to a true unsung hero of Samurai movie actor, Seizo Fukumoto. His performance was incredible and for anyone who wants to become an actor, this film is a must-see for sure!<>A nice film, reminds me a bit of The Wrestler.

If people can get past the expectation that this film is on any big studio level and it is an indie/low budget film, then I think they can get past some of the more annoying rookie aspects of this film such as the sound, some of the script, and some of the acting.  For a low budget indie film, this film has a beautiful look to it.  The actors do their best with what is given it seems.  While this film has a lot of shortcomings it does hit on some major areas of McPheresons life and ministry...both the good, the bad, and the ugly of it.  While it is sympathetic toward her, it doesn't hide her sins and problems.  I think the thing that annoyed me the most on the movie was the sound editing and equipment.  It was hard for me to hear some of the dialogue which was frustrating and then having to turn down the movie to almost zero on some of the preaching scenes.

It doesn't always convince, but it's the most approachable Polish production to date.<>There is much here to find admirable but a whole lot less to genuinely like.<>like an exercise in calculated nostalgia<>This is thoroughly a family affair, but with the Polish brothers' upcoming film Manure just around the corner, Stay Cool feels a bit rushed, suggesting nothing more than an homage to Pretty in Pink or Some Kind of Wonderful.","Not cool no matter how hard it tries.<>This film left melting Henry and scarlett a lot, yes its cliched and yes its unrealistic, but its a comedy, both of the main characters played their roles very well. The script is not that bad, and the last part of the movie is actually very good. So for this being a very good solid film, and liking the performance of Winona Rider the most, I give "" Stay Cool "" a C-.<>This movie was a little... rough at first... bits of humor... some of it just had me shaking me head... but it's not the worst film I've even seen.<>If you have anything that wasn't finished at high school, you can do it sometime, just step in and stay cool with the consequences!<>After graduating high school and getting as far away from his small home town as possible, Henry McCarthy(Mark Polish, who also wrote the screenplay while his brother Michael directed) made it big by writing a best selling novel about his high school experiences.  That entitles him to give one high school commencement speach.  But somehow the airline is not so impressed when they lose his luggage.  At least Henry has friends(Sean Astin & Josh Holloway) who are still there to give him a ride from the airport.  And then Henry starts immediately obsessing over Scarlet(Winona Ryder) who barely knew he existed in high school and has problems of her own currently with her ex-husband Brad(Marc Blucas).

""Stay Cool"" is an uneven comedy with some great moments in amusingly detailing how high school never really ends.  One can simply try to move on as best as one can.  Just as much as Mark Polish's awkwardness in the lead works both for and against the movie, the movie's main strength comes from its supporting cast, namely Winona Ryder who definitely needs to be in more movies.  Otherwise, there are a couple of odd references and product placement.<>There was nothing cool about this disaster of a movie!<>The cast does a good job, and while it has a good story, I felt they could have made it a little more dramatic.<>I really enjoyed this.  It wasn't hysterical,  although it had its moments,.  It wasn't life altering,  although it had a message.  It was just entertaining.  An interesting and intriguing journey. I'll probably watch it again.<>An unexpectedly smart high school light comedy/drama. I'm writing this recently out of high school and enjoyed this movie to a decent extent because of how much I could relate to it. I don't know if I will feel the same way in twenty years or so but for now I still liked this film. 

With a pretty impressive cast, this movie was pretty fun. The main character could have a lot better, but saying that I thought he did well with the more impressive cast around him. I mean you had Jon cryer Chevy chase and Winona Ryder to work with. Chase was one of the characters that did not work for me. He was really the main character of that one story line that was really unrealistic and irrelevant. 

While I will say that obsessing with your high school for twenty years is ridiculous, being months out of high school I found the plot to be very interesting and creative. Obviously brining adults into a high school movie like this was not done well, where I was asking they know he's not really in high school, right? There were also a bit too much subplots that seemed to be used to fill in time when they could have done some really good stuff with what the movie is really about. That being said,I did enjoy them no matter how unnecessary they were.

I see how some say that this film is cliched and a ridiculous plot for a high school movie, but for me I found its current, personal relevance very fun to watch and reflect on. It's not something to be taken seriously as a statement on the four years of high school we all have but rather more of a fantasy where your high school thoughts are with you for years. Take it as a reflective work of your high school memories and enjoy!<>5 minute special ... could not finish.","Janet DuBois, Ken Johnson, Jonathan Sheldon",,,,PG-13 (Some Drug References|Sexual Content|Language|Some Underage Drinking),,"SDDS, Dolby Digital, DTS",

Gets better the older you get.<>Joel Schumacher has never been my favorite director, As much as I love Batman and Robin, And St. Elmo's fire. The rest I've never given a chance.

This is a slow burn odd and strange look at american and it's breaking point. The idea of consumerism and many other themes are explored. Micheal Douglas is really good as a psychopath on a random rampage. Brilliant ending to a well written script.<>Michael Douglas is so good here. I think this is one of his best, and he saved this film. The plot is simple, a struggling working man goes mad.<>Few movies have that ""rewatchability"" factor, and this is one of them. Michael Douglas was definitely robbed of an Oscar nomination for this movie. 

This is a superb dark movie that takes us through the life of the main character in one day. Do not go by the critic's average. This is an excellent movie. 

I was surprised that Joel Schumacher directed this movie; while I'm not a hater, he has made some terrible movies in his time (namely Batman and Robin).<>Pure brilliance and so relatable. 
A must watch<>The film is admittedly over-the-top, however, ""Falling Down"" still manages to be a dramatic, emotional rollercoaster of a film that manages to perfect every aspect of itself to deliver a groundbreaking vigilante film whose messages still remain relevant to this day.<>I had seen clips of iconic scenes from this film for a long time but never watched the movie. Well I finally just did and what a disappointment. I was hoping to be rooting for the anti hero- but he is awful and not redeeming. Ok well at least we have a ""hero"" Robert Duvals character right? Wrong. He was not heroic at all at any point. The sub plot with his wife is ""resolved"" because he asks for dinner before going to the final show down. 

   I disliked everybody in the film and my only rooting interest was the same as the police, that he would got shot and it would end.<>What a weird, wacky, and stressful story on today's society in a clown's outfit and orders breakfast during lunch haha...","Timothy Hyde Harris, Arnold Kopelson, Herschel Weingrod","Feb 26, 1993 wide",$40.4M,Warner Bros.,R,,"Surround, Dolby SR",

Colorful is the kind of movie that is perfect in many respects and a reason why I watch movies. It feeds both my brain and soul, it is smart and incredibly emotional without being sappy and it is a terrific achievement and one of the most shamefully underrated and rarely seen anime films in recent years.<>This movie is beautiful in every way - except the actual animation and art direction.

However, the film Colorful boldly explores and investigates suicide, after life, bullying in Japanese setting. 

From the opening sequence until the last, you can't help but root for Makoto and Pura-pura as they try to beat time for another chance of after-life.

While watching the film, I can't help but remember one of Hirokazu Kore-eda's masterpieces, After Life. Because it also delicately talks about death and after life.

On the other hand, it's impossible to imagine a better film of Pinter's play than this sensitive, disturbing version directed by William Friedkin.","This is very much a slow burner of a film but I certainly felt it became quite sinister in tone and its intriguing, as a viewer we know very little about the lodger who it appears is targeted by two mysterious men. He isn't someone who is easy to like or feel sorry for, certainly at first but the tension that undoubtedly builds as things become more and more intense in terms of the constant questioning and aggravation by said mysterious men.

Its one of those films in which you, the viewer, finds themself analysing whats going on and trying to guess what led to things and what may, or may not, happen next. I thought the performances were quite good - the clear distress on the lodgers face is very well put across and I'd say I felt a shiver or two down my spine. This film mainly deals with the theme of manipulation, that and control, I reckon. I felt it also made me question how much anyone really knows other people your only mildly acquainted with.

This is by no means an especially visually scary film as such but it is effective in terms of putting across a sense of distinct unease, of something untowards being in the pipeline. It didn't surprise me to find out that this is a film adaptation of a play, as its pretty much all set in the same building/location. I don't doubt that its a bit too slow and subtle/boring for people who prefer their films to be fast paced, with lots of CGI and the like but that aside, its good and is worth a watch for those interested in it.<>William Friedkin is an odd choice as director of Harold Pinter's very English and claustrophobic one-set play. He casts it very well, and hones in on faces to animate the drama. Only the very particular black humour eludes him - although Sydney Tafler, Patrick Magee, Dandy Nichols and Robert Shaw are all excellent, and the production design - the small front room of a grotty seaside bed-and-breakfast - is pitch perfect. Judicious editing would have improved things too.<>This is a glacially paced, stagy, and confusing mess of a film.<>""The Birthday Party"" starts with Meg(Dandy Nichols) making a delicious looking breakfast of fried bread and corn flakes for her husband Pete(Moultrie Kelsall) who announces that a couple of men are interested in renting a room at their boarding house.  Their only other tenant is Stanley(Robert Shaw) who has been living there for about a year.  Enter McCann(Patrick Magee) and Goldberg(Sydney Tafler).

Ordinarily, I would complain when a movie like ""The Birthday Party"" does not expand on its stage origins, in this case from a play by Harold Pinter(who also wrote the screenplay) first produced in 1957, but here William Friedkin's claustrophobic direction works wonders in its mind games that play on the very nature of identity and could have also served as an influence on ""The Prisoner.""  Of special interest are the funky visual effects used in the film's climax.  And even as disheveled as he is in torn pyjamas, balding and overweight, Robert Shaw is still a force to be reckoned with.  My only major complaint is that this movie could have been much more tightly edited, especially in the end.<>The earliest and most impenetrable of Friedkin's play adaptations, and surprisingly one of his very most visually distinctive films. Worth mentioning is the rare treat of seeing such a young Robert Shaw playing such a different role than one would expect from the guy who played Quint and Henry VIII. Pinter admirers are more likely to find it accessible, but like me who are unaccustomed to such extremely ambiguous, if not downright contradictory, if even existent exposition will simply be subjected to an exhilaratingly unnerving experience.<>Harold Pinter's brilliant early film, The Birthday Party, is one of his best efforts, and perhaps, with The Homecoming, the pinnacle of the Theater of the Absurd.  Performances across the board are outstanding, with Robert Shaw outdoing himself as Stanley Weber.  Moultrie Keisall as Petey is excellent but understated, and his final words really put the cherry on the birthday cake.  (sorry for the pun).  Top marks, 5 stars, classic.<>Helped a lot to understand the play by Harold Pinter more deeply :)
Do not expect a normal plot... it belongs to the so-called ""Theatre of Absurd"", so you may never know what is going on and many interpretations are possible!<>An early Friedkin movie, all set in a quaint british B & B and based on a play by Harold Pinter.  Amazing performances all round as long-staying guest Robert Shaw gets emotionally terrorized by two gentlemen in the front room.<>This is an excellent screen version of the fabulously menacing play by Harold Pinter.<>Superb comedy in the banality of dialogue - its a bit of a weird play, not sure what its about, but that might be the point ... it seems to be about paranoia, but that might be me being paranoid","Max Rosenberg, Milton Subotsky",,,,G,,,

Neste meio tempo, ajudam mórmons contra bandidos e mexicanos na disputa por terras. Muito bom filme<>They Call Me Trinity is a spaghetti western movie that has a lot to offer to a viewer. but first, let's talk about the plot, which is the weakest part of the movie, as it is very predictable and simple, but still good: this guy, Trinity, a bandit, meets his brother, Bambino, who has faked to be a sheriff because he killed the real one. Trinity starts to solve the problems of the village in which his brother is a sheriff, and tries to stop some criminals. Even if the plot is simple, we can know the characters very well during the course of the events, even if they are simple, too. Now let's talk about the real strong points of the movie: the action and the fun. This movie has lots of action going on, as the main character is the fastest gunslinger of the west, but it's all funny, thanks to the ""special effects"", that make the movie like a comic. The action scenes are very well written, as you can the different combat styles between Trinity and his brother, but there is always space for good old punches, instead of guns, and it's very funny, too. As I said, They Call Me Trinity is also very funny, but not thanks to jokes, as the characters say funny things , but they speak in a serious way, and sometimes the scenes can get even funnier... for the wrong reasons, as the movie aged very well, as some action scenes got hilarious with time, without getting ugly. Another great thing that I would like to point out is the relationship between the two main characters, in which Bambino looks like as if he hates Trinity, and at the beginning you can't really tell if they're really good or bad.
Now, let's talk about some more ""technical"" things. The soundtrack of this movie is fantastic, as it's very good, and I still think at it sometimes, and the visuals are still great after many year.
I would really recommend to watch this movie, as it is a true Italian masterpiece, that is very simple but still very enjoyable and laughable, that I see whenever I can, and that I hope that anyone who wants to watch something from the Italian cinema.<>The chemistry between Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill carried them through a lot of movies, but this is the best of them. A diverting Western spoof, it still holds up after nearly half a century.<>Tho not as incredible as ""They call me Nobody"", this film is a lot of fun.  Hill essentially continues playing the character from ""Nobody"".  

Going in, you should know this is a spoof of spaghetti westerns.  I don't want to spoil anything so I can't say much more.  There were some scenes that were so incredible that I backed up and watched them again.   The plot was both predictable and surprising.  It has a different rhythm than today's overly lean and hence entirely predictable films.

The acting is serviceable but won't win any oscars.  I enjoyed it.<>Fagioli anyone? Oh and fuck Tarantino for using the theme tune!","Joseph E. Levine, Donald Taylor, Italo Zingarelli","Nov 4, 1971 original",,AVCO Embassy Pictures,G,Scope (2.351),,

Entrails of the Beautiful Woman,,23,1 Reviews,"1,000+ Ratings",,spilled,,,Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu,,,,,"Unknown Actor, Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu","About as far out as exploitation cinema gets, and while too much time is spent on the porno aspects, it's pretty entertaining and there are enough money shots to impress fans","More porn than splatter, this classic Japanese splatter porn is very much a lesson in sadism. Things don't start getting truly interesting until just over half way through the film when the gore starts inching it's way into the picture.

Finally, in the last quarter of the film, after an overdose of some crazy cocaine derivative called Angel Rain, the last female victim turns into a sex monster.  Seems small doses of Angel Rain just make you horny, while large doses turn your skin inside out and give you both types of genitalia. 

Not since Killer Condom or Monstroid have I seen such phalic death but this may be the first time I've seen a dude get suffocated via oral sex. Of course, this time she doesn't just want your tongue, she wants your whole head and not the one between your legs.

It was nice to see only one instance of fogging in the film but the post production sound design still made the sex scenes less than desirable even if the ladies were very attractive.

Story wise, this probably makes more sense and is easier to follow when compared to its predecessor Entrails of a Virgin. Even regular movie goers could sit down and understand what's going on. Sure there's some bizarre sex monster going around killing people at the end but at least it's pretty well explained and foreshadowed.

Splatter porn isn't for everybody but if it's the kinda thing you're into Entrails of a Beautiful Woman is probably right up your alley.<>Sex, drugs and violence are the order of the day in this bizarre Japanese rape-revenge gorefest. Movie begins with a woman being drugged, and brutally raped by five Yakuza goons. She is then informed that her sister has been sold to the African sex trade, and the Yakuza have similar plans for her. She does however escape, and makes it to a clinic, but the trauma is too much and she kills herself, but not before telling her story to the clinics Psychiatrist, who ultimateley takes it upon herself to avenge the woman. Pretty much non stop sex and eventually violence follow. This film also features a strange demon of gore, who in one memorable scene receives fellatio from a strung out women before killing her in grisly fashion. Apparently this demon is some weird hermaphrodite though as it manages to invert its penis and its next victim dies from asphxiation via cunt / gooey mess. Yeah, this movie is pretty fucked and I loved every minute of it. While comparisons to films like I Spit on Your Grave or Thriller: A Cruel Picture are unavoidable and even valid, this film has enough of it's own thing going on to make it a must see for fans of the perverse, fucked up and ultra violent. A must see if you fall into that category.<>Very bad Japanese pink-horror. A young female psychologist is tortured and humiliated by the Yakuza and injected with a drug called Angel Rain. The side effects however turn her into a nasty blood demon who extracts her own brand of justice. Everything is crap from the acting to the special effects. This movie is decadent, sleazy and at times vile. I suppose there are fans of this type of movie but I thought it was shite. For completists only.<>This is an awesome Japanese version of ""I Spit On Your Grave."" Only difference is, this woman becomes a penis-headed demon when she cuts, chops, blah, blah, blah. Hilarious results, though. Totally worth it. Pretty much everything you'd want or expect in an Exploitation flick is packaged in this little ditty.<>Very bad Japanese pink-horror.

This movie is decadent, sleazy and at times vile. I suppose there are fans of this type of movie but I thought it was shite. For completists only.<>The last 15-20 minutes is really the only reason to watch this; the rest is just cold sadism. Basically, a drug named Angel Rain is used by a vicious band of Yakuza to incapacitate its prey. If you sat through the first hour of pointless scenes of anal rape (""I'm going to fuck your ass until you split in two""), gang rape, suicide, mutilation, and lhabia chomping -- though the mutliple sword execution scene was kinda neat -- you are rewarded with one of the best ""what the fuck"" endings in horror history. You must see it to believe it, but I'll just say the Yakuza get their cruel raping returned tenfold, by a bloodsoaked & carnivorous Aliens-esque penis monster.<>A woman, who every time she snorts coke turns into a gore monster.

This is the sequel (in name only) to the infamous Japanese sex/gore film ENTRAILS OF A VIRGIN, by the same director, Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu. Komizu also directed the third and final installment in the series in 1987, most commonly known as RUSTED BODY: GUTS OF A VIRGIN III. His only other directorial effort of note is the zombie film LIVING DEAD IN TOKYO BAY in 1993.<br>

Now onto the story. A group of Yakuza gangsters rape a girl, Yoshimi, who's been searching for her sister. Her sister had ties to the Yakuza, and they tell her she was sold into prostitution in Africa. They then inject Yoshimi with a highly potent form of dope called ""Angel Rain"", and two more Yakuza thugs rape her.<br>
<img src=""http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk2/Hexenkult/apic22.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman (1986)""><br>
She manages to escape and finds a hospital where she tells a nurse her story, before making her way to the hospital roof and jumping to her death. The nurse decides to avenge Yoshimi's death and infiltrates the Yakuza clan. She gets caught and, of course, gang-raped like Yoshimi. They inject her with a large dose of ""Angel Rain"", which kills her (or so they think). Instead it inexplicably turns her into a hulking, skinless beast with a giant mutant boner! Then she exacts her bloody revenge on the Yakuza members.<br>

The ridiculous and thread-bare plotline is just an excuse to string together the various softcore scenes and, eventually, the gore. I say eventually, because it's 50 minutes into movie before the creature makes an appearance. The movie is only 68 minutes long. That's about 20 minutes worth of gory carnage. What a missed opportunity.<br>
<img src=""http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk2/Hexenkult/apic13-3.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman (1986)""><br>
The creature reminds me of the skinless people in HELLRAISER, except for the giant phallus, which resembles the ""chest-bursting"" critter from ALIEN crossed with the writhing fly larvae in the dream sequence of Cronenberg's THE FLY. Sound disgusting? It is. <br>
<img src=""http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk2/Hexenkult/apic16-2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman (1986)""><br>
The last 20 minutes feature some decent gore FX and one memorably disgusting scene involving the creature's ""appendage"" and a sleazy Yakuza girl. Let's just say there's some disturbing foreplay before leading up to a stomach-bursting ""climax"" (a la ALIEN mentioned above).<br>
<img src=""http://i276.photobucket.com/albums/kk2/Hexenkult/apic17.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman (1986)""><br>
That's pretty much it. If you've read this far, then you already know if this is the type of movie you want to see. It's a fun and mindless diversion for fans of gore, who don't mind softcore sex scenes; or for fans of softcore sex who don't mind gore scenes (whatever floats-your-boat). It could have been a lot better though if the creature had started his/her wrath of gory, mutant-phallus carnage earlier in the movie. Oh well. In the immortal words of Martin the caretaker in Friday the 13th Part VI, ""Some folks sure got a strange idea of entertainment!"".<>I enjoyed this followup to Entrails of the Virgin more than its predecessor--it has more of a plot and is a bit more stylish.  Still filled with cheesy effects and sleaziness, but interesting for the fan of exploitation cinema...<>This is much more shocking than the first movie. I have a hard time figuring out what kind of audience the director had in mind when he made this movie. It's basicly an hour of rape and and a monster with an alien penis.

Review by SeraphicWings  ?? 1/2
Philosophically speaking, it grows on the right path.

Practically, it deviates widely.

Sometimes by taking shortcuts - for example, giving the wife the bar storyline with the sole purpose to progress the plot by providing him with a valid stepping stone towards going through with the video.

Sometimes by taking the scenic route - aka, the loooooong, bendy talk that ultimately gets them to put their clothes back on.

Still interesting in terms of studying the way we self-steer, thrusting options, making pointed arguments that are often detached from reality, solely because subconsciously we desperately want or don't want to do something, trying to convince the world by first convincing ourselves.

Duplass is, as always, an effortless pleasure to watch; and that's about it regarding performances.

Mediocre.<>I really love mumble core even though I increasingly don't want to, so the naturalistic acting and meandering dialogue was all good and on point. This one focuses on men and I guess it's critiquing masculinity by exposing their spiritual weakness, but this genre is so good at exploring sides of life we don't normally see and I see men making weak decisions all the time. I guess I was disappointed by its choice of focus. Pretty engaging though.<>Mumblecore does have some of the most real conversations, interesting obstacles and simply revealing character arcs.  This film in particular makes some really interesting choices about what the characters chose in the end,  It also naturally showed their motives, moods and shifts in relationships.  No commercial film could have thoroughly addressed the psychology of the straight male view on anything, let alone their own sexuality.  The film beautifully and carefully builds.  All the elements included, though they seem unplanned, really contribute to the meaning of the story.  Pitch perfect dialogue and structure.  Thorough character arcs.<>Paradoxically, I thought the last scene was the most interesting, but it kind of went on too long and had an anticlimactic ending.  I get the feeling that this entire film grew out of a late night conversation not dissimilar to the one in the film's party scene.  But stretching it into a full-length feature?

Rental?<>awesome movie... Vdo excellent..<>Great crime drama about what happens when Jack hires a crew of small time thieves (Max, a small time thief who thinks he's something more, Jaimie, his girl who collects poisons, Piece, the gunman/scre-up, and Mars Girl, Pieces' girl who's not all there), to help him obtaine a pair of antique dueling pistols, but of course theirs no honor among thieves. Featuring great performances by Matthew Lillard, Valeria Golino and Vincent D'Onofrio and a rock solid script. Originally a low budget off broadway play (means theirs alot of dialogue), Spanish Judges manages to feel familiar (in a good way) and fresh at the same time. Released direct to video it has been crimenally neglected by the public.<>Heist movie, with extra cheese -- no-one chews the scenery quite like D'Onofrio. Definitely not one for the ages, but certainly fun.<>Crime movie with a lot of twists and intense acting, the only problem is (and I freely admit this is more my problem then the movies) I kept expecting a bigger twist at the end that the movie never provided.

It's rare that I, a lover of topsy-turvy plots, will forget the ""unexpected twist"" at the end of an otherwise excrutiatingly boring thriller. Alas, I have. I, as a matter of unfortunate fact, do not remember much of anything from this tepid, uninvolving, poorly acted and thrill-less thriller. It was quite awful. I give due credit to D'Onofrio merely for showing his face. [b]* (out of ****) D[/b]

Curtis Hanson's [i]8 Mile[/i] is as conventional a film as you're likely to see from the man who brought us films ranging from the ingenious police thriller [i]L.A. Confidential[/i] to the sweet dramatic comedy [i]In Her Shoes[/i]. The film, which stars brutally mysoginistic rap artist Eminem, is about a white trash nasty who has dreams of becoming a hip hor star. Kim Basinger steals the show (which, unfortunately, isn;t much of a feat) as the candy-coated chocolate candy's mother. She really is great. Brittany Murphy plays the same role she usually plays, doing quite well. It's okay. If you're a fan of the man, see it. Otherwise, skip it. [b]** (out of ****) C[/b]

I've seen reviews for Norman Jewison's [i]Rollerball[/i] calling it one of the best science fiction films ever made. I guess I've missed something. The film, while entertaining as a silly '70s sci-fi flick, didn't really od it for me. I've heard it described as a cautionary tale, but I found it no more ""cautionary"" than [i]Death Race 2000[/i]. What exactly is the warning? Don't create murderous sporting events for entertainment? I'm pretty sure, while the idea is entertaining, that will never happen. [b]** (out of ****) C[/b]

John McTiernan's remake of Norman Jewison's [i]Rollerball[/i] is as bad as silly action films can be. It doesn't even have the guts to be reprehensible as well as horrid (which is why it has been awarded a half star instead of a zero, which is reserved for the boldly horrid, not half-assed laziness). The film, which contains some of the worst acting, direction and writing you'll ever see or hear, is almost completely incomprehensible and contains scenes that will make you howl with laughter.

And you do.<>With its painterly eye for the parched saltpans and wheat fields bisected by snaking roads, the film has a lonely, elegiac beauty. The unexpected comedy can give way in an instant to something darker, but it's never mean-spirited.<>Told in a fractured, non-linear style, with overlapping narratives retelling the story from different perspectives, the parts can be tantilising but the whole doesn't come together the way it should, the payoff being more of a whimper than a bang.<>What sometimes shapes as promising about a bitsy tale of an outback search for a missing teen is never quite delivered upon here.<>There are things to appreciate - including Young's performance and strong support from Radha Mitchell - but the fling-us-here and fling-us-there structure ultimately feels gimmicky, and lacks a certain grace.<>A jigsaw puzzle of insignificant things form the canvass on which Sue Brook's drama about guilt and loss are set... (they) do come together, although some like me, may not be satisfied by the outcome<>Right from the get-go, Looking For Grace throws tonal consistency out the window, bouncing from broad comedy to serious drama at will, and not always seamlessly.<>Thoughtful, odd and sometimes frustrating.","I have walked out of two films.  This is one of them.<>I'm not sure LOOKING FOR GRACE quite knows what genre it is. It's difficult to categorise - sort of a drama that is slightly quirky and very, very dry with its humour at times. There are some interesting observations on mundane life. Told in a series of stories of characters that eventually converge and reveal what it is going on, it takes a while to understand what is happening. Grace's story is told first with almost no dialogue. It's quite slow but beautiful and uneasy. The acting is average except for Odessa Young, who plays grace, and Radha Mitchell (Grace's mother) who is not as good as Young but does express deep emotions with nuanced facial expressions. The story is quite intriguing although the climactic shock that occurs is a bit cliched now. There's not a lot of character development. The soundtrack, featuring quite a bit of piano, is gentle and slightly humorous in feel with stunning visuals of Australian landscape. Since seeing the movie, it has grown on me as I have reflected on it. It isn't great - and most viewers seem to be rating it so low that in my weekly guide I suggested it should be avoided. But if you're looking for something a bit different, you might enjoy this.<>A disjointed and disappointing Australian movie, a waste of great actors.<>The opening scenes with teenage Grace running away with a girlfriend worked best for me. I've travelled across Australia on a bus many years ago and the scenes were relatable. Also, Grace's relationship with a young guy they meet on there is handled truthfully. 
Once the older cast's stories are added on, it loses ground a little, although they are also honestly told and relatable.  I am not sure anyone really learns anything here, though. Maybe it's making a point that so called perfect lives aren't what they seem.  The ending scene with the mother was down played  and drastic.<>The most boring film since the Pokemon movie.<>This film is truly boring.  Don't waste your money. Yes, yet another truly dull Australian film.  What was the director thinking?????<>I see a lot of movies and this was one of the worst I've seen in a long long time. Shocking!<>Possibly one of the worst films I've seen. No plot to speak of, bizarre dialogue, frankly just weird.

Grade: C-<>67%

The clean cut boys vs the shaggy boys. Slightly better then the average 70's biker flick and one of Lee Frost's better films as well (at least of the ones I've seen). Starts out really strong, then peels out on ridiculousness toward the end.

No they are not saving POWs this time like in The Losers but rather Michael Haynes runs some girls off the road killing them & the driver's military brother (Tony Young) & his buddies infiltrate the biker underworld seeking revenge.  Even though he's the leader of the gang The Devils William Smith sorta takes a back set in this one but he is still cool ass even w/ limited involvement.  I laughed my ass off in the end when Smith & his gang are getting the holy piss knocked out of them by Tony Young & his military buddies & is just like 'hey that's enough..there's the mother-fucker (Michael Haynes) that you want'.  Not a chicken shit move but there is no reason to die when you're not the son-of-a-bitch to blame<>I'm embarssed to say I watched this one. Its bad, really, really bad. It's not even worthy of a Saturday B-movie-a-thon.<>Only worth your time if you're as into biker flicks and Larry Bishop as I am. Ultimately though, the third act Green Berets vs. bikers sequence (in which said Green Berets use over-the-top military tactics to terrorize, beat, and capture a mostly-harmless biker gang in the name of revenge against ONE member of the gang) is pathetic and almost Punishment Park-esque. Seeing a biker flick like this makes me see perhaps why Larry Bishop would make Hell Ride an almost fantasy-like flick focusing solely on biker warfare where any and all normal protagonists (not to mention cops!) are nonexistent. It's much more interesting without the good-guy/bad-guy lines already drawn for you.<>Biker film from the early 70's has a green beret that is out to find the biker gang that is responsable for his girlfriend's death.  Below average biker film has alot of filler including a montage of the green beret and his friends training to be bikers.

Full review in Spanish","Steven Spielberg returns to the director's chair for the first time since 2018's ‘Ready Player One'. This latest venture sees the acclaimed director adapt Arthur Laurents' iconic play, turning it into a thoroughly entertaining musical that features a stunning debut performance from Rachel Zegler. The newcomer leads a cast that includes Ansel Elgort, Ariana DeBose, Mike Faist and Rita Moreno, who happened to play the role of Anita in the 1961 adaptation. Spielberg takes audiences on an emotional rollercoaster across 156-minutes with spectacular musical numbers throughout. Even people who aren't the biggest fan of musicals will more than likely enjoy this highly anticipated modern-day remake.

Set in Manhattan's Upper West Side, ‘West Side Story' follows two rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, as they fight for control over the San Juan Hill neighbourhood. But a forbidden romance between Maria (Rachel Zegler), sister of Sharks leader Bernardo, and Tony (Ansel Elgort), a member of the Jets who's now on parole, threatens the safety of everyone involved, and as tensions rise, an all-out war is on the horizon. So, will this whirlwind romance prevail? Or will territorial violence allow for devastating consequences?

Rachel Zegler's sensational debut performance, and a now Oscar-winning turn from Ariana DeBose, top a plethora of brilliant performances from the entire cast, and Rita Moreno's return to the role of Anita is nothing short of incredible. Tony nominee Mike Faist also gives an arresting performance, bringing the character of Riff. As well as impeccable performances, ‘West Side Story' is packed full of exhilarating musical numbers that take place across the streets of New York. The show stopping musical numbers and colourful costumes, courtesy of Paul Tazewell, make for a staggering spectacle fit for a cinema screen. The extravagance of ‘West Side Story' allows Steven Spielberg to show off the film's top-quality technical aspects including Gary Rydstrom's sound design, Adam Stockhausen's production design and Justin Peck's choreography.

Frequent Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski provides ‘West Side Story' with sublime and expressive cinematography that brilliantly compliments the film's immersive technical details. Kaminski's attempt to replicate Daniel L. Fapp's Oscar-winning cinematography certainly pays off, even earning Kaminski a nomination of his own. Despite coming in at over 2.5 hrs, Spielberg and his talented cast keep you undeniably entertained across the 156 minutes, and don't leave you begging for the credits to roll. The remake stays true to the themes present in it's 1961 predecessor, but Spielberg updates certain themes to make way for current issues present today, one of which being gentrification. The film also shines a light on heavy themes like loyalty, gang violence and racism.

Rachel Zegler, Ariana DeBose and Mike Faist shine in Steven Spielberg's modern re-imagining of Arthur Laurents' well-loved play. With a New York-based Romeo and Juliet style story at its core, ‘West Side Story' sets itself up as a film that both entertains you with show-stopping musical numbers, and breaks your heart with emotional crescendos. Tony Kushner pens the script for this colourful retelling and composer David Newman and conductor Gustavo Dudamel rework Leonard Berstein's iconic score, turning ‘West Side Story' into a triumph for director Steven Spielberg and all those involved.<>Thought the film was OK, it was definitely not my favorite from the adaptations, I truly think the film deserved a little more than what it was given, and it was definitely hyped up bigger than what we were presented. It's not a terrible film, but it's definitely not a film that you want to continue to watch over and over again. I think the acting was OK, and the music was OK, it didn't deliver the way the original film did<>Although it's based off a play, I was hoping the film would be less theatrical. Cinematography was spectacular and Tony and Maria's voices worked well together. But way too long. (38%)<>Steven Spielberg has done a great job with his first musical as this ""West Side Story"" is a nice mix of ‘50s musical tropes and modern sensibility. It is full of colour and movement and emotion, with cinematography that effectively captures these changing moods. The dancing and choreography are wonderful and not at the expensive of its narrative as its ""Romeo and Juliet"" story origin has never been clearer.<>Phenomenal movie!  Ansel and Rachel are magnetic and the dancing is off the charts :)  can't wait to watch it again!<>As good as the original, if not better.<>A masterful reproduction and amazing to see such amazing knew talent reprise, these classic and iconic roles in the immortal story of Romeo and Juliet<>This was a good adaption of the original. Of course, nothing beats the original as that was a true classic. However, this was one of the better remakes I've seen of a musical. 

Was so happy to see Rita Moreno come back too! The dancing and songs were done very well.<>Watched west side story again yesterday and can't stop thinking about it, what a true masterpiece by Steven Spielberg. The acting of everyone is so good , how did Rachel Zegler not got a nomination and how did neither Mike Faist or David Alverez receive a nomination for best support actor. Still blows my mind the colors, the production design, the costumes, the editing and the camerawork, New York has never been so alive. Can we talk about how the oscars didn't nominate West Side Story for editing, it's a shame, because the editing is perfect. This movie has so many emotion and I gets me every time. The songs are incredible remade of the original and the dancing is so alive, that must have been a long rehearsal. I honestly don't have a favorite scene of the movie, Tonight, America, i feel pretty, openingsscène, the Jetts, crazy boy and the school dance are all masterclasses at all technical level. The opening of the movie alone, that long wide cameramove, which don't ask me how they did it, is already so good. Steven Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of all time and the fact that he is still making different movie generes and challenging himself with new stories, is so incredible and I can't wait for the Fabelsman<>Overall, I truly admired that director Steven Spielberg has set himself a challenge of doing his first musical, and for the most part, his work yet again is as impressive as expected. The film has a wonderful style, delivering fun entertainment along with many heartfelt and dramatic moments. Costume designs and leading performances are wonderful, and the musical numbers are a major highlight, delivering fun through the impressive talent on screen. With so much to brag about, I am saddened to see the film's biggest flaw is pacing.  The film drags on in key areas, including the opening act, and audiences will feel the runtime as the film enters its conclusion.","Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Kevin McCollum","Dec 10, 2021 wide",$38.5M,20th Century Studios,PG-13 (Some Strong Violence|Brief Smoking|Strong Language|Suggestive Material|Thematic Content),Scope (2.351),"Dolby Digital, Dolby Atmos",

I think that the majority of the ingenuity went into shooting this on 35mm film and using composite effects, look-alike actors, some of the original costumes and the same puppets to recreate the look of that film. A lot of work when you think about a movie that no one but video store and late night cable mutants like, but hey — here you are on our site.

Also, I realize that this movie and the one before it are both junk, but look — Rick Sloane did all the Vice Academy movies and yes, I've watched all six of those movies* more than six times each. Whenever I watch one of his other films — like Blood Theater, The Visitants or this one — I always start to think they're really not good and then I say, ""But he did the Vice Academy where there's a robot cop* and that one where Dolly Parton's porn star cousin took over Los Angeles** or when The Commissioner and Miss Thelma get married*** or that time that The Commissioner's son unleashed a virtual reality stripper supervillain or when all the girls went to jail***** so I'll just be nice.""

So sure, there are some changes. People have internet sex instead of over the phone, so Rick Sloane is in the future with us. McCreedy has been locked in a psychiatric hospital after he blew up the film studio real good to destroy the hobgoblins. And everyone that survived has gone away to college.

If you get the DVD of this, the original cast pretty much makes fun of the actors who took over their roles.

Now, let's get on to making Vice Academy 7. Rick, if you're interested, give me a call or seeing as how we're in the future, send me an e-mail.

*Vice Academy 2 of course.

**Vice Academy 3.

***Vice Academy 4.

****Vice Academy 5.

*****Vice Academy 6.<>A follow-up made 22 years after the original.  It is meant to take place soon after the happenings of the original with the characters played by look-a-like actors in 80s-style clothes. (Yet there are internet porns and flip-phones.) The old security guard is now institutionalized for blowing up the movie studio at the end of ""Hobgoblins"". The kids visit him as the demonic puppets do their thing. Several self-referential comedic bits, even to MST3K! ONLY watch if you've seen the first one and you enjoy stuff of the quality of Monsturd/RetarDEAD.<>A great throwback to the 80s and original, even made over twenty years later and still looks and feels like the campy first film!<>Hobgoblins 2 is a perfect example that you can't make lightning strike twice especially when it comes to awful movies.  The 1st one was a complete fluke that it was so god awful enjoyable that you can't duplicate it.  They honestly shouldn't have gone to the well a 2nd time other then those involved needed the cash.  People who shit on the first one need to see the 2nd to see how not to do it & makes it feel forced.  I had popped this one in not moments after watching the first one because I had so much fun  but right away I knew that it wasn't going to be able to pull the same thing a 2nd time.  In fact I turned it off after a half of an hour thinking that I wouldn't waste anymore time & just bask in the brilliant awfulness of part one...but the next day I figured I had to get back to since I invested in the first.  Trust me on all accounts it's shit & actually quite disappointing.  Get fucked up & watch the first one; skip this one even if the temptation is there<>Hobgoblins 2 was every bit as awful as it should be, but still was entertaining for a little while. If it was done by MST3K it would have been a new classic. However instead it was just more nightmarish acting with some lifeless furry puppets. Just enjoy a few libations to ease the pain.<>As a self parody, it's brilliant. As an original horror film, it's just like the first<>I could be merciful to Rick Sloane on the first one thanks to MST3K.  This one gets no mercy.  Good news first: The puppets are back and look awesome.  Now the rest:  This is a prequel, sequel, and a prequel/sequel.  Nick is in the Army, Daphne is a woman of ill-repute who somehow got less attractive.  Or is it more? Amy is a sexually-inhibited snob as opposed to a sexually-inhibited woman with low self esteem.  Kevin has motivation.  They all have motivation somehow to go to college.  There they meet McCrady, a patient who blew up a film vault to kill Hobgoblins, but noon of the kids remember that, thus the whole prequel/sequel issue.  Horrible does not do this movie justice.  But the puppets return.<>""Hobgoblins 2"" wasn't as painful as I thought it was going to be...and that's about the best I can say about it.  Still, what I'd expected to be a jaw-clenchingly bad experience actually entertained me in a couple parts (true, that roughly translates into: I chuckled a few times at parts that were actually -intended- to be funny, but still).  And it's certainly easy to lambaste with friends, even if the movie occasionally tries to do that job for you.

And that actually brings up the main problem with ""Hobgoblins 2"": it doesn't know what it's trying to be.  Hell, even director Rick Sloane said in the commentary that he was trying to keep the audience guessing as to whether this movie was intentionally bad, or if they were really trying.  That works for awhile, but eventually the characters become so grating, and the effects are so laughably bad (already cheaply-made puppets from the '80s don't age well...), that towards the end, any attempts by this movie to be anything aside from godawful are fruitless.

Still, ""Hobgoblins 2"" is watchable, particularly with a group of friends and some booze.  And if you're feeling adventurous, you could probably make a drinking game where you take a shot every time Kevin's shirt randomly changes from scene to scene.  And any movie that you can make a drinking game to automatically scores a few points in my book.<>Hobgoblins 2 is the long awaited (20 years!) sequel to the infamous 1988 cult classic that many dub one of the best worst movies in the world. This time, those pesky hobgoblins can appear when someone calls their names 3 times in a row, and instead of granting fantasies, these little creatures just exploit everyone's worst fears (lame). It's up to 5 very kids who eerily resemble the 5 from the first film (not to mention they have the same names) as well as Old Man McCreedy (unfortunately not the same actor) whose been institutionalized every since blowing up the studio in the first film. With the first film, there were plenty of moments that made me smile and even chuckle a bit, but all of that is lost on this incredibly stale and legitimately crappy film. Director Rick Sloane tries to recapture that magic again, but I think he tries so hard that he overshoots it and this film just becomes downright annoying. The women are still written the same, which was kinda amusing, but nothing could really salvage this failed attempt at making another cult classic. Lame film that took forever to end; even at 89 minutes.<>It was actually really funny, in a low budget lame horror movie type way.",Rick Sloane,,,,,,,

But by the time the third act delivers its predictable finale, seasoned audiences are left to reminisce about the movies that did it all better.<>...it is, in the end, impossible to view The DUFF with anything less than almost total disdain (especially given the above-average nature of its source material).","I would have liked it if it was anything like the book.<>This movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. They make the character so unlikeable you enjoy it when they get rejected. The only characters that were enjoyable to watch were the teachers. The overall plot of the movie was dumb with a predictable ending. They oversexualized a simple high school relationship. The dialogue was very poor, and it felt as if they were speaking from a robot. The only enjoyable part of the movie was watching her get played by the guitar guy.<>It's undeniably a cornball fest, but it's also incredibly sweet and there's moments where it goes from doing a good Mean Girls impression to just being good. Its side characters are fun, especially the teachers, and it has a cute and relatable story with great flow. None of its pieces are as memorable as those in some of the best high school comedies like Mean Girls, 10 Things, etc., but Mae Whitman (Bianca) and Robbie Arnell (Wesley) have clear chemistry and they're really fun to watch together. Also, I'd watch Allison Janey as a mom in anything, ever.<>Pales in comparison to the Freaky Friday remake or Mean Girls but Whitman is a capable enough actress and the film has this self-aware lack of seriousness from start to finish. Sometimes this teen-comedy indie is amusing but it's a very heavy-handed almost preachy narrative.<>Unfunny and unoriginal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>Somewhat cliche and cheesy but it has its moments. And it does a good job of bringing itself up-to-date with the latest high school trends in social media and cellphones. Don't look for something really deep, but it has a moral and it's a good one and I like the main character. A little bit shallow, probably good for the teenage and early 20s crowd. Older adults may pass respectfully.<>Finally, a high school farce that breaks the mold. Sure, the end is predictable, but not the characters and their relationships. In the Duff, we have two hotties and a quarterback that break from the plastic mold of shallow and emerge with  some depth. The dialogue is more organic and the interplay between the leads is natural and unaffected. Certain tropes remain, however, there's enough of a breaking from the teen comedy mold to make The Duff freah, funny, heartfelt, and enjoyable.<>Although predictable a fun watch!<>Nothing new but good message to teens and adults to love yourself.<>Good happy teenage movie for those thinking about their social place and reputation within a high school. Can be seen as having a cheesy happy ending, but, its realistic and pragmatic.","McG, Mary Viola, Susan Cartsonis","Feb 20, 2015 wide",$34.0M,CBS Films,PG-13 (Some Language|Crude and Sexual Material|Teen Partying),,,

Seriously just because you throw in some blood, body ripping and naked chicks, doesn't make it a horror movie.  This was so crap and boring, just don't bother.<>Barricade (not sure how the title relates to the film) is about a couple of old friends (regular horror duo Raine Brown and Joe Zaso) reuniting in Germany to rekindle their own friendship and possibly more while camping out in the woods, which happen to be inhabited by demented, mutant, cannibal freaks that kill just about everyone they come in contact with (which is a lot in the surprisingly crowded woods) in some really gory ways. I'm not doing the word ""gore"" justice here. This HAS to be one of the goriest films I've seen in awhile, especially from goremeister director Timo Rose (who also makes an appearance in the film) who usually goes for the gore, but never this gory! The big problem with this film is Rose's attempt to make an American film through a German perspective, which dilutes the acting and storytelling, thus causing several bad and awkward moments that either go nowhere or irritate the viewer. It's a shame because everyone's heart is in the right place. If you can get past those moments and just stick to the ""horror"" and ""gore"" aspect of the film, you may find it somewhat enjoyable. Beware, there is one particularly squeamish and upsetting scene involving boob torture and dissection; definitely a highlight of this film. Wow.<>WOW! What a nasty little film this is. The realism of the gore in this film makes Hostel and Saw look like Disney films. We are in Wrong Turn/The Hills Have Eyes territory. A cannibalistic family that kill pretty much all who come to the Black Forest Mountains of Germany. I love the way this film has been shot, the speed of the editing really adds to the realism of the kills. Also I like the way it switches from German to English throughout various parts of the film. It's the most sadistic and brutal film that I've ever seen. I absolutely love Raine Brown and may have found my new indie horror chick favourite?<>When three friends two of which havent seen each other in years decide to reunite in germany for a nice weekend trip of relaxing hikeing and camping in the woods they never thought it would end up the way it did as it turns out there is a long forgotten cannibal family hideing out in those same woods and have been feeding off of tourist campers for years now the friends must fight back if they wanna survive, Pretty thin story is just a cover for all the blood and gore they threw at this movie which wasnt all that bad but wasnt all that good either gore fans will love watching this.",,,,,,,,

http://366movies.com/2012/12/25/357dracula/<>If you wanted to film a staged ballet, this is the way to do it:  Hire Guy Maddin!  The Canadian filmmaker rips apart the footage (Super 8 and other formats) and edits it back together in a delirious montage, processing it to one inch from death (or beyond -- this is the story of Dracula, after all) so that it looks like a silent film with faux tinting in phantastic colors with blurry edges and stark contrast.  A few sustained dances creep in but this is largely an exercise in assemblage. The well-known story is given a few tweaks and it doesn't hurt that it takes place in the Victorian era, a Maddin specialty.<>Starring Wei-Qiang Zhang<>The story of Dracula seems to work well with Guy Maddin's unique artistic talents.<>Bram Stokers Dracula performed through music and dance.

We are probably talking about his most refined work, which together with the director's work, results the most perfect film of his filmography. [Full Review in Spanish]<>Immersive, lush and tender, yet oddly lacking in emotional power despite the affecting performances, Youth is a frustrating and joyous film in equal measure.<>As a writer-director, Sorrentino is an unquestionable talent; it would just be nice if he didn't rely on such pretentious contrivances to tell us what we already know.<>Like The Great Beauty, Youth has great cinematography but when the results are this loathsome, I'm reminded of how much I would rather see a dimly lit, poorly shot film with a great script than another monstrosity with great stills.<>Sorrentino's floating gaze transcends mere petty politics for much deeper, almost epiphanic readings of his characters' respective journeys.<>Fred, Lena, and Mick are not interesting characters; nothing about their appearance stands out, and their problems (infidelity, betrayal, alienation) are all very bland.<>It is the sort of the film where you must allow the musical score to wash over you like waves lapping on the beach whilst your eyes bathe in the colours on screen.<>While the dreamlike imagery is lovely and attempting to solve Sorrentino's ambiguous themes will probably help you develop a strong mental stamina, it's not an experience many would consider unpretentious.<>There are several major problems with Youth. What it has to say about youth, maturity and old age remains unclear.<>his can be seen as a companion piece to Sorrentino's The Great Beauty, exploring as it does the process of growing older... Sorrentino's triumph is that he does this in a way that's both beautiful and life-affirming, yet also heart-breaking.<>It's a film that engages you in many small ways even if the plot thread tying everything together is never quite satisfying.","Caine & Keitel are sublime, the dialogue is smart and the irreverence is seducing. A great ""Hollywood"" movie for Paolo Sorrentino.<>Sorrentino provides another visually and emotionally stirring meditation on some pretty heavy, and often seemingly contrasting, themes which he explores utilizing his unique blend of humor and heart.

At a certain point our past must begin to look further away than the inevitable future and, once beyond that point, as you grow older that change likely becomes more and more pronounced. Sorrentino doesn't despair in this unavoidable truth and instead beautifully confronts and even celebrates this stage in a life through some well written dialogue, that along with the score, induced goosebumps more than once.

The cinematography was engrossingly gorgeous with some memorable shots that created a tempting backdrop to tell any story in front of.

Caine was an excellent choice for the lead and played his role brilliantly with Keitel offering great work as well. There were no weaknesses in this colorful cast but I was embarrassed it took me as long as it did to recognize the Maradona character.<>There's no doubting Sorrentino has his own style, and there are times during Youth when you do wish that he would tone that style down somewhat. However, there is real beauty in Youth, and Sorrentino pulls astonishing performances from Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel as ageing friends at an alpine retreat for the duration of the film. It's not up there with his best (Il Divo [2008] remains the pinnacle for me) but it's certainly more cohesive than his most recent, Loro (2018), which although impressive, really misses the extra hour or so of footage that is present in the Italian release.<>Beautiful! Visual poetry and beautiful symbolism of living a human life: the lightness the dark, the beauty and the and ugly, most of all avoid the mediocre (?).<>Not as beautiful as La Grande Bellezza, but still very good.<>The Greatest Beauty
Paolo Sorrentino's latest movie, the director's return to Cannes after the worldwide success gained with the Best Foreign Movie Oscar (yet the Croisette didn't particularly liked the film which later on won at the Academy Award), could and should be appreciated by the Neapolitan director-screenwriter's admirers, for his usual subtlety of camera work and the and memorable lines, as well as by his detractors, for the unexpectedly solid and consistent story development, something that in the past The Great Beauty's director has seldom achieved.
And indeed there is much more beauty in Youth than in Sorrentino's former hit, exactly for the savvy mix of images and narration, for the excellent compactness of the cinematic language and writing, regrettably missing in the calligraphic series of beautiful images that made up The Great Beauty.
In an exclusive and secluded thermal hotel on the Swiss Alps gather, like elephants at a savanna watering hole at dusk, guests of every age and origin, each looking for something different but all joined by the lack of this ""something"". With the calm and lightness of a glider, the movie flies over Fred, a retired great musician and conductor searching his human dimension in addition to his musical one, and Mick, a famous director searching a last movie which could amazingly seal a career that, however glittering, started to show the unmistakable signs of a slow decline. The movie takes the viewer, with crafty and touching empathy, to the final results of these searches, harmonic for Fred, dystonic for Mick.
Captivating in the title choice, identifying youth with the inner search and growth rather than the body biological age, Youth is structured in dwindling layers, strongly integrated and unified: a protagonist (a self-controlled and convincing Michael Caine as Fred), a co-protagonist (the dependable Hervey Keitel as Mick), two secondary characters (an emotionally involved Rachel Wiesz as Fred's daughter and a cautious and endearing Paul Dano as the Californian star), circled by a chorus of characters painted with few yet definite strokes, reminding of the Commedia dell'Arte: the football legend beyond Sunset Boulevard, the masseuse of few words, the Alpine guide, Miss Universe, the Queen representative, the 100% made in Hollywood movie star (an ironic and charismatic yet ineffective Jane Fonda), the mixed group of your screenwriters, the silent couple…..
The risky strategy of mixing faked reality (the Queen, the real pop start, the football star) to real narration proved to pay off: most probably Youth shall not gather the prizes and success of The Great Beauty but surely represents a clear leap forward towards Paolo Sorrentino's full maturity as a director and a screenwriter.<>i saw many movies like this one and sorry still didn't get it at all.too may symbolic scene and the story itself is...whatever<>Paolo Sorrentino orchestrates an eloquent ensemble performance, David Lang's evocative music, Luca Bigazzi's gorgeous cinematography and into an operatic and sagacious testament to evanescence of beauty, memories, celebrity and florescence.<>At one point during ""Youth"", directed by Paolo Sorrentino, a character says, ""focus on some insignificant detail."" And that's sort of sums up what's wrong with this film. Beautifully shot and well acted, you can't quit watching, but the simple-minded dialogue keeps interrupting. For example, Harvey keitel's character seems to exist for no other reason but to annoy, with his disagreements and dogmatic utterances. I like watching Michael Caine, who plays an accomplished but retired composer, talk about the past, his regrets,  which is interesting, but not as inspired as it thinks it is. I was really looking forward to a short scene with Jane Fonda as an aging Diva telling off a long time director friend. But even though she's good in it, it's not very good. The dialogue is cliched and shallow. There's a great scene near the end where Harvey Keitel imagines all of his leading ladies throughout the years speaking lines of dialogue . It's interesting and cool and meaningful. But not quite enough of those. You'll probably reach the end of this movie feeling like you didn't get it. But maybe there wasn't really that much to get.<>Mas que filme maravilhoso. NÃ£o dÃ¡ nada de mÃ£o beijada. Fiquei querendo re-ver na mesma hora que acabou.

Otherwise it's ok.<>This would've been an excellent film if the two leads weren't out of their league.  Cybill Shepherd, god bless her, has the enchanting part down but speeds through her lines in the most annoying manner.  You just wish Bogdanovich had told her to slow down some.  Plus, she doesn't quite sell the innocence enough.  Barry Brown looks more like a hippie than a 19th century expatriate, and he doesn't develop any sort of personality throughout the entire picture.  The overall impression of the acting is that of a high school play you're forced to sit through because your little sister is in it.  On the other hand, the camera work is stately and shows proper restraint.  The final shot is especially haunting.  The film is a fascinating failure; I would recommend watching it despite its flaws.<>Beautifully mounted version of Henry James' novella suffers from a misguided lead performance by Cybill Shepherd and tone from director Peter Bogdanovich. Shepherd plays the lead as if she was in a Howard Hawks comedy and Bogdanovich doesn't seem to have the sense to realize he's taken the wrong approach with the lead and the tone is completely off so by the time that the tragic ending happens, there's no sense of loss.<>Painfully boring, the acting is wooden and unappealing, a misguided mess. I do not know what happened to Peter Bogdonovich on this one, especially since he had three smash hits just prior - The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc? and Paper Moon. A huge disappointment. Cybill Shepherd is way out of her acting league in this one.

Bao Ting-tien (Ti Lung) leads a rescue mission and is able to save one captured soldier. Said soldier informs them that their Prince is in an enemy stronghold, and they must rescue him at all costs. With action every ten minutes or so and a wicked finale, The Deadly Duo is light on character development but makes up for it with bravado and bravery.<>An awesome action flick from Chang Cheh, it's short, sweet, well-paced, and has a surprisingly big feel to it despite its 81 minute run-time.  The outdoor scenes are not bound by Shaw sets, but feature actual location work, and the action scenes are frequent and violent in the Chang Cheh tradition, with Lau Kar Leung brilliantly handling the choreography duties.

Martin Kove has a very underrated film career & underrated tv career. Steele Justice is fun to watch if you were a kid renting movies like this in the late 80s. it has the worst sword fighting scene that turns into a sweet getting thrown off a bridge & getting blown up bad guy kill finale. best line of the film ""i am the only justice"" after blowing up the final boss. Martin Kove is cool.<>A fun popcorn film! Action, revenge, sadness and vengeance! <>Martin ""Sweep the leg"" Kove is a Vietnam vet who begins wagon his own war on drug lord Soon-Tek Oh. This film is pure 80s cheese. The story may sound similar to Michael Cimino's underrated and Oliver Stone scripted film ""Year of the Dragon,"" but this film is much closer to Chuck Norris-territory than anything else. Still the film has an enjoyable enough of b-action film actor list, including Sela Ward, Ronny Cox, Shannon Tweed, Bernie Casey, and Al Leong as ""Long Hair."" I actually think my favorite part of the film was the synthesizer film score by  Misha Segal, who brought us the soundtrack to ""The Last Dragon"" and ""Ninja III: The Domination."" Two stars for ironic entertainment value. 1/2 star for actual film quality.<>Such a low budget movie. Undoubtedly has unnecessary actions and dramatic moves.

He plays a Vietnam vet who confronts the Vietnamese mafia and old war adversaries in America.  A surprisingly strong supporting cast here.  I think Cove was underutilized in his career.<>I watched this on Netflix the other night. The main reason I decided to check this out was because it had John Kreese himself (Martin Kove) rockin' the good guy role, and after seeing his evil performances in The Karate Kid as well as Rambo I figured it'd be fun to check him out in a good guy role. What I found out is this movie has an all-star cast of bad guys from other movies. You've got the aforementioned Kove as down and out ex soldier John Steel, the dude that played Dick Jones on Robocop as the police chief, Bill and Ted's history teacher as a police officer, the chinese dude with the goattee who always plays bit bad guy roles (mostly in John Carpenter movies) in another bit part, and the evil Asian commander dude from Missing In Action 2 playing another evil Asian figurehead. So anyway, the movie....well it's pretty formulaic...and the action scenes are extra cheesy, and the montage scene was really lame (jogging on the beach worked for Rocky III but not here) but if you are the kind of guy that enjoyed TBS's Movies for Guys Who Like Movies then you'll like this one too.<>""He isn't being recruited, he's being unleased.""-Police Cheif Bennet (Ronny Cox)

Good acting and writing make this indie film a worthy relatable film watch. <>Elephants is exactly the kind of film that I love to discover. First, it was clearly created by filmmakers who had a vision and something to say and weren't just following a Hollywood formula. I love that. The relationship portrayed is realistic and the actors pulled it off wonderfully. I also really appreciated the cinematography. Every scene was lit with care to enhance the story. Highly recommend.<>Who hasn't been there - wanting to re-activate an old love story and then considering all the ups and downs.

What follows is an intense and rich dramedy exploring all aspects of relationship. it's complex, it's adorable and the actors draw you right into it with their stunning performance. Great cinematography and score make this indie gem complete. I highly recommend watching it.<>I loved this very realistic, touching portrayal of a complex relationship. It's hard to find movies that explore all aspects, the good, the bad, so I give it a hearty recommendation for single people, couples, old married folks, everyone!<>Okay, this film really makes me think about how I've felt about past films because the bar has been set so much higher with ELEPHANTS. I hope this gem of a film gets the attention it deserves because this is truly wonderful romantic dramedy. It's not just about two real life characters finding each other, or reconnecting, it's that it delves deeper into the complexities of relationships than one normally sees in studio or other indie films. The cinematography is excellent, the score is spot-on and I felt the performances to be absolutely captivating. I really can't say enough good things about this film, other than it's so worthy of your time. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend. Congrats to the team behind it!!<>When you think of romance or relationships depicted in film, invariably cliches pop to mind. Boy meets girl, Jennifer Aniston-cuteness, inevitable bliss. To quote the film Annie Hall, ""If only life were like this.""

Elephants is about love, but it eschews such simplistic cliches and instead gives us a look at a relationship that feels authentic and lived in. There's such a wonderfully complicated mix of emotions between the characters in this film. That's the norm in life, but not in the movies... where we often go to avoid life's pain rather than confront it. But Elephants doesn't shirk from that complex reality but embraces it. Which makes not just for good entertainment, but makes this film art. Something one rarely finds in film.

There's joy here, laughter. But also genuine sadness. And there's real craftsmanship to the filmmaking. Beautifully shot, well acted, with great music. Writer-Director Alex Hanno is a sure hand behind the camera. With work like Elephants, we have a real artist to watch in the years ahead.

Bravo to Elephants!<>With the indie gem Elephants, Alex Hanno deftly delivers the kind of tonally-changing relationship interplay we pine for - and unfortunately don't often get - in a big studio romantic dramedy.

To draw us in, Hanno presents us with once-separated characters now reunited and seemingly back on track: They joyously resume reminiscing, then flirting, then sexing, then arguing in a world that's immediately relatable in its simple complexity. The flirtatious, banter-driven dialogue is tack-sharp, and the chemistry between the lead male and female roles sells the film's core relationship. Spot-on cinematography and well-chosen support music (which veers toward upbeat jazz) drive scenes in which two people that busted up long ago remain irrevocably drawn to each other.

Yet Elephants ultimately thrives because it ends where it does for most of us: in that blindly hopeful space between longing for a reanimated relationship to succeed, and that crushing moment in which we're again reminded that previously incurred damage to the dynamic just can't be cleaned up, and will indeed lead to yet another implosion. Kudos to Hanno for crafting an ending which avoids the tired platitudes mainstream cinema too often builds into its offerings in their attempts to create constant sunshine.","Alexander Hanno, Samuel Lancaster, Luca Malacrino","Dec 7, 2018 limited",,Indie Rights,,,,

The first one is this movie I had rented from Net Flex on the basis that Buster Keaton was in it. Before I say any thing else this movie was pretty good. Any who I watched and watched, finally Buster was in it for only three minutes as a plumber. Not even a speaking role at that. After I got over my little heart break, I did enjoy the movie. It's about this American who sold this house back to original owners descendants during WWII. The movie takes you through the different years that the house went through and how the American family ended up owning it. I really enjoyed it.

God's Gun (A Bullet from God) (Diamante Lobo),,34,2 Reviews,250+ Ratings,,spilled,,,Gianfranco Parolini,,,,,"Jack Palance, Richard Boone, Lee Van Cleef, Leif Garrett, Gianfranco Parolini",<>The film is all action and no brains.,"I had no idea that this Italian Western was an Israeli co-production and just a few years before they'd make it to the USA, Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus would work with The Irwin Yablans Company and Cannon Film Distributors to bring this movie to screens all over the world.

Sam Clayton (Jack Palance, as always, a grinning force of complete menace) and his gang have taken over Juno City, stabbing men and assaulting women before leaving the town in the bloody dust. No man will ride out to stop them, except Father John (Lee Van Cleef), a holy man who rides out unarmed and takes the guilty gang members to jail.

The gang breaks them out of jail and kills the priest, sending a young boy named Johnny (Leif Garrett!) to Mexico to bring Lewis, the twin brother of the dead man of the cloth, and he comes back with vengeance on his mind, even if it turns out that Clayton ends up being Johnny's father.

Also known as Diamante Lobo and A Bullet From God, this is Lee Van Cleef's last filmed Western (and second movie with Garrett). It was a rough film for Richard Boone, who had started having health problems, then got drunk and walked off the set, leaving the Israeli location before he even dubbed his dialogue. He'd say in an interview, ""I'm starring in the worst picture ever made. The producer is an Israeli and the director is Italian, and they don't speak. Fortunately it doesn't matter, because the director is deaf in both ears.""

That deaf director was Gianfranco Parolini, better known in America as Frank Kramer, and the maker of some wild stuff like Sabata; Yeti: Giant of the 20th Century; Kiss Kiss, Kill Kill; The Three Fantastic Supermen and writing If You Meet Sartana… Pray for Your Death. It was written by John Fonseca, whose career is all over the place, acting in The Uranium Conspiracy (also produced by Golan), serving as a dialogue coach and even shooting stills on the sets of Don't Open Till Christmas and Slaughter High.

How did I get this far without telling you Sybil Danning is in this movie? Am I slipping?

This may not be the best Italian Western you've ever seen, but honestly, the end with Palance rambling in a cemetery and alternating between being paternal and horrifying, well, that's worth the price of this blu ray. And Lee Van Cleef? Always just right.<>I had this recommended to me a very long time ago when I was first starting to get into and review westerns. It has taken this long because the genre still hasn't endeared itself to me for the most part, and I watch them sparsely. Still, I have been going through this western pack of late and the middle entry on it is God's Gun. A western done by Golan and Globus before their Cannon days I am assuming. This meant that the movie is goofy fun at times, and kind of stood out from the other spaghetti westerns I have seen in a good way. Well good for my sensibilities.

God's Gun is about estranged twin brothers, one a priest and the other a gambling shoot first style gunfighter, both played by Lee Van Cleef. When the priest is killed, a young boy from the town journey's to find the brother and get revenge. Sound pretty normal except that for a small amount of the time the gun fighting brother plays it of like he is the specter of the priest to scare and kill the gang that outnumbers him. Those parts were great. In fact, although the movie takes a long time to get set up, the payoff is totally worth it. 

It wasn't all great though. As I mentioned, the movie takes its time getting going. It seemed to prefer introducing all the characters in long scenes, drawing out everything until the priest is killed. Jack Palance kind of got on my nerves as well. Although it was funny to see his villainous character slap and laugh his way through everything, he seemed more like a joke than anything else. He acted like a drunken fool and laughed at everything that happened. But, for me at least, the laugh looked so fake and weird...I don't know, maybe Palance just weirds me out.  Also, there is a scene where the gang goes into the bar, after stealing two young girls and proceeds to have a sexual assault party that went on way too long. It was off-putting.

Still, flaws aside, I did like this movie. It did feel a bit cheap and fun, while also feeling a bit sleazy at times. The basic premise and Van Cleef's characters make it worth recommending.<>For all those out there that don't get Spaghetti Westerns please don't review this movie because obviously you don't understand that this movie has everything that a spaghetti western should have, especially in the end the scenes when the whore blows off the back of one of the bad guys heads, with a double barrel shotgun.  For Spaghetti Westerns, It doesn't get much better than that. Also the end scene when Lee Van Cleef shoots the gun out of the bad guy's hand and then shoots it in midair is classic. Then he goes on to quote from the Bible before he shoots him. I think we now know where Samuel L Jackson stole that from. Oh yeah and when's the last time you did see an intelligent Spaghetti Western, anyway, give me a break.<>I saw the Mill Creek version.
Very bad film quality. I would love to see this movie again in a great quality version.
It could have been better, but it could have been worse.
I recommend finding a version in good audio/video quality and judge for yourself.
If you like Grindhouse and Spaghetti Western Movies then this should be a must watch.<>Considering this film features legends like Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance its a shame that it was produced and directed so poorly. While not an entirely new story it does have a similar feel to ""High Plains Drifter"". Basically Van Cleef plays two roles here, one as a non violent priest and the other as his brother a former gunfighter. Palance is an outlaw in charge of a gang who has just robbed a bank and is terrorizing the local town where Van Cleef's priest currently resides. When the priest is killed the brother comes to clean up the mess. Problem is, the retribution scenes are very unfulfilling and because it was an italian film the dubbing (not sure why they didnt just use english to begin with) was terrible. Personally, i kind of would like to see this remade with newer actors as i think the story could have a lot potential if its reworked and re-imagined a little bit.

4/10<>Better than expected 1970's ""Saddle Sleaze""--God is a Spaghetti-Cowboy!!!<>This was terrible!!!!

(1977) God's Gun
SPAGHETTI WESTERN

DUBBED

  European budget by Cannon producers Yoram Globus and Menaham Golan despite familiar Hollywood cast such as Lee Van Cleef, Pat Boone, Jack Palance, Sybil Danning and a very young Leif Garret star in yet another revenge tale obviously inspired by Leone's famous Western trilogy particularly ""For A Few Dollars More"" also starring Lee Van Cleef.  This simplistic plot formula showcases a bunch of ruthless outlaws called ""The Claytons"" lead by the Jack Palance creating havoc from town to town stealing money and killing sherriffs.  And after stopping to another new town, and going into a saloon before shooting an innocent bystander, a preacher (Lee Van Cleef) without any guns then steps in to return the so-called killer back into town to get himself prosecuted by the laid approach sheriff (Pat Boone)but is not very easy on doing that.  (Plot Spoilers)  The preacher succeeds on bringing him back but later gets himself shot in the back since these so called outlaws were obviously going to return and free him.  They then create havoc throughout the town with the sheriff and judge doing nothing since they're alot of them.  The boy (Garret) escapes to inform the other brother about it since he has no idea what he looks like except that his other brother lives in another town and will do whatever it takes to go there.   It is soon discovered that the Lee Van Cleef has a brother who happens to look exactly like him; Lee Van Cleef playing two roles- one a preacher and the other a ruthless gunfighter, the rest is obvious.  

 Going into this film without expecting anything and I have to say I was totally fascinated and realized this is like a  Quentin Tarantino movie since it's spontaneous and over-the-top, such as the revelations or the twists some can be seen a mile away, using plenty of other Western movies using ""the Clayton"" name from the Wyatt Earp movies.  some scenes were unecessary particualrly the long assault scene that happen in the saloon but it's nothing a fast forward button couldn't fix and despite the unmemorable dialogue I thought this film was overall quite decent.   

3 out of 4<>It's a shame that the pairing of two great actors like Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance couldn't have resulted in a better movie.

A lot of his films seem to exist in their own universe. The noir elements of this film and ""Trouble in Mind"" feel quite similar, but even his films like ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" or ""Choose Me"" seem to exist on their own plane of reality. Tom Berenger plays a hard-boiled private investigator hired by Anna Archer to tail her shady boyfriend, which leads to a Raymond Chandler-esque serpentine mystery. Add in a competing P.I. in the form of equally tough-as-nails Elizabeth Perkins and you have an interesting love triangle of sorts between the three leads. What makes ""Love at Large"" memorable is writer/director Alan Rudolph and the unique style he brought to an oddball series of films he made in the 80s and early 90s, which seemed to exist somewhat out of time (""Trouble in Mind"" ""The Moderns"" ""Mrs. Parks and the Vicious Circle"" and this film). These films were throwbacks to another time, but incorporated 80s/90s pastels and neon color palettes, along with modern sensibilities to the characters and situations. Composer Mark Isham's score also nicely balances a score that feels period yet also contemporary. Although the ""Love at Large"" meanders and is slow at times, the cast, which also includes Ted Levine, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee, Kevin J. O'Connor, Annette O'Toole, Anne Magnuson, and Neil Young, and Rudolph's visual style make the film well worth watching for fans of old school noir and 80's indie flicks. FUN FACT!

Prodotto di notevole qualità.<>Helped me have closure on a friendship.<>Sad, lonely, and beautiful

This movie was great for its refined use of the actors. Ray Romano of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" really shines as a supportive friend to Mark Duplass. Duplass, who created ""Room 104"" with his brother, does an amazingly empathetic job of depicting a man on his last legs because of disease which has wrecked his life. Their friendship onscreen is poignant and touching. When the plot shifts weight from gloom to inspirational touches such as the namesake of the film which was a game they played together as children, it really takes flight and relays a powerful and emotional piece of cinema. Duplass's previous performance on ""Creep"" makes this seem like it would be Oscar-worthy. It was a truly touching and sentimental ode to staying in the game of life, even though it was told through the pervasive lens of suicide and lonely depression. It's an eye-opening movie that is undeniably heartfelt.<>I want what they have.<>This is an understated film about a difficult subject - the impending death of one mans close friend. I thought it was quite poignant at times and I found some of the interactions between the two main characters, Michael and Andy, at different times amusing and sweet. Its a good depiction of male companionship - the two guys seem quite comfortable with things, which may be hard to understand given the brutal situation they feel but what choice do they have? I suppose. As I say its relatively understated, i.e. its not full of Hollywood industry forced sadness, forced saccharine sweet aspects - it handles the heavy themes in a pretty matter of fact way, with numerous arguments highlighting their frustrations and differences of opinion. 

Its quite a human film, I think its fair to say. Thoughtful stuff - worth a watch.<>3- A pair a well matched leads have tremendous chemistry in a film that takes it's time to get going. Yet, the final scenes within the climax are powerfully emotional and directed with a slight touch that leaves plenty of room for both actors to work.<>Couldn't finish it b/c it was too depressing! Otherwise good though.<>Not funny, certainly not smart. Was worried that it would have a happy ending. At least they followed through.

This film truly is a tour-de-force of independent film-making, or at least that's how it seems to this member of the audience.

Stars JOHN DALL, a name that vaguely rings a bell.
Conflicting reports which year:  1949 or 50?

Kinda like BONNIE & CLYDE way later.<>Gun Crazy is notable for its attempts to demythologize the gun--the thing which seems so central to American history and what it means to be an American. Conflict through arms and liberation by the gun pervade myths about the American Revolution, and notably, the American West, which would have been a burgeoning genre upon this film's release. And of course, there's that politically contested stuff about gun ownership and gun rights being baked right into the U.S. Constitution. That's not to say that Gun Crazy is entirely anti-gun, but it does suggest that the allure of destruction (the purpose of the gun itself), the power of the gun, the satisfaction of experiencing release from danger, and self gratification through those aforementioned means ultimately can only have one outcome: you live by the gun, you die by the gun. Because of that, this 70-year-old film remains prescient.<>""No, no. We go together, Laurie. I don't know why, maybe like guns and ammunition go together.""
Bart, if you want to stop people getting killed maybe separating the gun from the bullets is actually a good idea.

Gun Crazy is a relatively early take on the 'crime couple' narrative that has been adapted to a range of genres since Bonnie & Clyde themselves seized headlines, and it's a testament to the influence of the film on later renditions of the general story that much of the plot feels pretty conventional. However, there are plenty of interesting components that make the film distinctive - some creative cinematography, a foggy final chase, and in particular the dynamic between its two leads, Cummins' Laurie and Dall's Bart. Far from male and female iterations of the same gun-toting roughneck, Annie is a capable and somewhat manipulative femme fatale with a streak for violence (who claims that she shoots people after acting out when scared, but is shown to take a thrilling pleasure in it), whereas Bart is a timid, generally nonviolent man who is driven to crime to satisfy the demands of his new wife. They take to crime as if it were a drug, reveling in the high but (at least for Bart), experiencing a hard crash in the aftermath. Though the seduction and manufactured fall of a partner are defining traits of the femme fatale, but it's still done competently (if not particularly innovatively) here; Laurie's treatment of Bart is not explored as a corruption of a pure man, but an amplification of his innate darkness, an interesting take that can be interpreted as tying into a more explicit anti-gun message. Regardless, a solid mid-range noir-thriller.

On a lighter note, this kid straight up brings a gun to school to show off in 1950 and the worst that happens is he's asked to speak to the school superintendent. 
(3.5/5)<>Gun Crazy – A Mini Masterpiece 
How did the King Bros and director Joseph H. Lewis (Cry of the Hunted '53) turn this independent work into a striking, major motion picture? Lewis was not considered for major productions yet he consistently turned minor projects into major works! This is pure genius at its best and while contemporary so-called ‘movie makers' constantly attempt to imitate him, they fail at every turn, and the more money they pour into their copycat works the more they elevate Mr Lewis. Director of photography Russel Harlan (Lust For Life '56) works superbly with Mr Lewis, bringing stylish visual spectacle to this well above par movie. 

The surprising performance of Irish Peggy Cummins as the sociopathic female carnival sharpshooter is a well-earned femme fatale classic. Her partner in crime is a fellow sharpshooter - who because of an incident in his youth, never wanted to ever use guns to kill anything again, is well played by John Dall (Spartacus '60). Both make a compelling pair on the tragic road to nowheresville. Black-banned performer Morris Carnovsky does a fine turn as a sympathetic small town Judge, with fellow black-banned writer, Dalton Trumbo smartly adapting MacKinlay Kantor's intriguing story for the screen. Production Designer Gordon Wiles keeps it looking interesting & Composer Victor Young provides a dramatic music score – complete with a song sequence. 

The Warner Achieves DVD 9 transfer offers clear images and sound.<>A solid film noir, the camera work inside the cars for the getaway scenes are great!

Peggy Cummins was the star of this.<>Peggy Cummins should be in the 'femme fatale' Hall of Fame. A sharpshooting bad girl meets gun loving good guy ... you know the rest.<>Simply an out-and-out classic, we follow the life of a guy (John Dall) who is fascinated with guns, which is okay - until he meets his better half (Peggy Cummins). Both actors look and seem like that ""perfectly nice couple who live next door"", but together they spark like dynamite, leading to a action-packed, cross-country chase that's sure to excite.

Need I add, I couldn't get out of ""my"" Sunnyvale quick enough. I am not, and never was a bogan. In that way, it is unfair to lump all state housing people into this category and I wonder about the ethics of making this show. 
This is realistic, ugly, scummy people. Not characters you would care about at all. Just bottom of the barrel, vile human beings. It's not funny so much as one big cringe. 
I rated it fairly highly as it is successful for what it is trying to portray. Except for Frankie.  No way he would get all those girls to do all those things. I think ...
I couldn't say if it is funny. Not to me, it's not.
It does drag out too long at the end and goes beyond ridiculous, though.<>One of the most unintelligent, hysterically funny & more truthful than people think film about Australia's Housing Commission World.

It's loud & proud & I find it a lot of fun...not for the faint hearted.<>That was really good for an Australian film!<>It was just like Fat Pizza and it was pretty funny.

For most of its running time, we don't have a good idea what Annie is up against, which makes the slow trickle of clues that much more tantalizing.<>Desperately underwhelming.<>There is a lot of potential shown in The Pact, but the clunky writing and bombardment of clichés end up overshadowing the better qualities of the film.<>McCarthy's film weaves aspects of the haunted house sub-genre with very raw, serial killer-esque horror.<>Horror, mystery, murders, secrets, and mediums-it all gets mixed up with some very effective storytelling that unfolds in a quietly unsettling way.<>Juxtaposes the supernatural with real-life threat, whilst holding a very strong point in maintenance of mystery.<>The Pact could have used a dialogue polish, but mostly it's a bracing low-budget horror film that plays with expectations to deliver scares and satisfactions.<>Where other films however may have fallen flat by rehashing old clichés, The Pact appears fresh by keeping much of its horror hidden until well into the proceedings.<>The Pact fizzles out significantly as it marches towards its rather generic final act...<>Manages to deliver a decent combination of supernatural and practical horrors.<>Nicholas McCarthy admirably tries to deliver both a terrifying tale of horror while mixing in more gritty elements, but doesn't explain much as to why.<>Quite easily, one of the scariest films I've seen in a long while... It's a corker.<>Debut director Nicholas McCarthy possesses a good grasp of effective, tension-building technique in this psychologically rooted chiller, in which dark, repressed memories of a turbulent childhood bubble to the surface.<>The film has some cheap thrills ... but lacks more sustained tension.<>The explanations for what has been going on are weird, fantastical and sort of reasonable, within the context of the story, maintaining the film's sense of grounded directness up to the very end.<>A satisfying ghost story without leaning too hard into trends. It's not a deliciously overwhelming feature, but The Pact has modest vision worth a look.<>McCarthy is clearly an economical director and what he gets on screen here - while hardly new - is still effective and occasionally creepy.<>A tightly controlled low-budget chiller whose occasional moments of unexpected special effects are set up beautifully by long periods of suspense.<>In the end, like a lot of genre movies, this one pulls from different inspirations, and so weighs in, by turns, as overly predictable and satisfyingly recognizable (part of genre cinema's one-two punch).<>In truth, there's nothing here we haven't seen before. But McCarthy, who also wrote the straightforward script, keeps the pace moving and the atmosphere eerie (if rarely terrifying).","One more movie where dead people get in touch with the living ones to help solve a murder, although the cliche I liked the ghost-story and the thriller atmosphere.<>A interesting Chiller This Thriller is a underrated little gem<>The Pact (2012) was really enjoyable from a horror fan point of view. It had just the right amount of spook, mystery and thrills. It held the same level of eeriness throughout. I was on edge the whole time. 
Nicholas McCarthy has perfectly directed this film as we experience as much as the character does, with the extremely tight halls winding through the house. 
It was predictable in some areas, such as the jump scare department but that is to be expected as everything has been done to death these days. However the storyline took many turns that weren't as expected. 
Caity Lotz was well casted for the role of Annie. Her performance was captivating and relatable. 
A little slow but It doesn't affect the overall feel of the film. I would definitely recommend.<>I didn't care for it. Something with the pacing, the timing.. it just didn't work. But Gary T (a reviewer on here somewhere who put everything in all caps and hated this movie..lol) . why don't you tell us how you really feel? Lmao<>The pact 18.2.21 6.6/0.
It was good. D.B.<>Garbage from start to finish<>A decent horror movie with enough thrills that will keep you hooked to it until the end. In the scary meter, I find it so-so but in the thriller meter, The Pact excels to the top. The tension in its last 15-20 minutes was an enjoyable ride! I find the story slowly paces at the start but once it picked up the mystery part of the plot, it quickly intrigued me to watch the film. The twist towards the climax caught me off-guard as it wasn't something I expect in this film. But I'm sure fans of this type of movie will surely like this film. However, what wasn't clear to me in this film was the relation of its title to the story of the film. I don't find any relevance of a pact to the film's supernatural and mystery theme.<>This movie generate suspense masterfully using slow camera zooming and minimal background noises. This is very cheap yet very effective. There were two particular scenes that made me breathless. It was like I was trying to hold my breath under water. These two scenes were pretty long, and this made me feel suffocated. Even more, the movie used very minimal jump-scares, however these scares were not false jump-scares and scared the heck out of me because I did not expect these scares. The plot was pretty conventional and the twist of this movie is pretty pleasant and made sense. However, it is not new and I have seen this plot before couple of times. Overall, the movie is very effective and suspenseful.<>Apart from the spirit after revenge plot, it is creepy and suspenseful. There are some good scenes in it . Recommended<>While it's storytelling and pacing are 50/50, The Pact's scares are top notch and even gets playful with its visuals.

Watched it with my mom<>With a cast such as this one, I had higher expectations. I was disappointed.It was more silly than it was funny.<>gr8 cast makes this one go<>Cute and funny the way Carrie Fisher does. Had a disturbing plot twist towards the end... but thoroughly enjoyable.<>Jesus wept! No wonder this was only a TV movie. Very hammy and cheesy, although there are some quite nice insider digs amongst the overacting barbs. This was clearly a vanity project.<>3/10. Overacting by everyone.<>Written by Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia, though she's done so much more underrated & often unknown stuff since then), starring her own mother, legendary Debbie Reynolds (Singing in the rain, etc), her former stepmother, legendary Elizabeth Taylor in her final film role, and the woman who played the character based on her mother in another film she wrote ""Postcards from the Edge"", legendary Shirley MacLaine. That's a lot of legends with some complicated connections in one film. Carrie herself has a cameo as a whore, and brother Todd Fisher plays a small part as well, to round out the family get together. Joan Collins, a different kind of legend perhaps & not quite so embroiled in the personal affairs of her fellow cast members also stars.

This television film naturally got more attention than it normally would have due to its impressive star wattage (hey, the ladies may not have been at their peak any longer, but they are still beloved, and especially in the States their names invoke greatness and glamour, and they never stopped working). Added to that the film marks the first 'reunion' of Debby Reynolds with the man-eater who stole her husband decades earlier, Elizabeth Taylor. 

The whole juicy scandal is of course part of Hollywood lore. Mike Todd, Taylor's third husband died in a plane crash and the distraught widow & his best friend, Mike Fisher, bonded over their mutual grief, falling in love soon after. Romantic enough, except that Fisher had a wife, Little Debbie Reynolds, and two kids at home. The ensuing tabloid scandal painted Taylor as a femme fatale and actually helped her career, while cementing Debbie as the All American Good Girl, helping her career just as much. The only loser in the long run was Eddie Fisher really, since the part of cheating bastard who leaves his babies cannot be turned into an asset by any spin doctor. In reality there seems ample proof that the marriage was pretty much over anyway, and that the studio used it to advance both their stars, and they ran with it, playing up what was at the most a tepid dislike to become cold burning hatred.

So the reunion of the two ladies did raise some interest, and the film handily plays on this, by letting them have a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte during which they talk about how Taylor's character once stole the husband of Reynold's character. A bit on the nose perhaps, but you have to please your audience.

Anyway, is this film all that great? No, not really, but it's far from bad, with actors who can always make the best of it, and think of Joan Collins' acting chops what you want, she does know how to play a cougar slut. Taylor's part is very small & her character is in bed most of the time, as she was even then not in the greatest health, but I liked seeing her as a Yenta with a thick accent instead of the sophisticated voice I'm used to from her. 

The musical numbers were the greatest disappointment, I really do wish they had put more of an effort into that, because it could have been pretty smashing. Still, they had their fun moments, most of them involving Reynolds, who may look like a dumpling now, but she's still got Little Debbie in there somewhere. 

The plot does wear a little thin at times, and there's a limit to how many cat-fights I can watch and still be entertained, but all in all, I'm glad I saw this film, I'm glad it was made, and if you don't set your expectations too excessively high, I'd recommend it for a fun evening on the couch.<>This film has a terrible script and also terrible acting; a complete waste of time<>Great actresses, but the story really stunk.  I guess it's supposed to be funny, but I rarely laughed.  If you took any ""old guy"" movie (like the old chatham/ golden boys) and compared it to this ""old gal"" movie... this makes all these ladies look like dried up/ slapstick/ rediculous ladies that got fat/ uptight or fixed up by liposuction.... and the guys get married to the younger gals and are actually desired.  Like wtf?  When they first learn to dance and are falling all over the stage, I just cringed.<>Cheesy and crass but the ladies are having a good time and if you don't expect a classic you'll have a good one too.","Lewis Abel, John D.

His plan backfires when his real daughter shows up and causes problems. To be honest, this movie was a bit of a snoozer. I found it at a Goodwill on VHS and hoped for some lost and forgotten horror movie about a killer doctor. Sadly, I was let down by the seemingly ""movie of the week"" type scenario.

Lemony Snicket)] employs an O. Henry-like twist of irony that first-time director Curtiss Clayton telegraphs long before it strikes.<>Oh the holiday season can bring joy and cheer among the flutter of fortunate folks with happy go lucky lifestyles. Curses to them all for being given the lives they lead! 

Based partially on the opera 'Rigoletto' which told the story of a curse placed on the licentious Duke of Mantua and his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto. In this film version of the opera, Rick would be Rigoletto while the Duke would still be the Duke, but referred to as Big Boss. I'll explain more dear reader, but don't expect happiness abound for this tragic tale set around Christmas of a wall street man who falls from grace for being naughty and not nice.

The poor soul here is Rick O' Lette. He is an executive at an corporation known as 'Image'. For his age, you would think he'd be the boss of this company. He is not. That belongs to a young douchebag named Duke. Duke is the type of boss that cockroaches would surely honor if he were ever the ruler of cockroaches. He is as mean spirited as Rick is, but if Rick were to have any redeeming qualities it would be that his lack of conscious towards ever being nice to people may stem from the fact that his wife passed on. It could be the only reason why Rick is the way he is, but sadly an excuse of that sort behavior won't help when he humiliates a nice young Japanese woman who was simply trying to apply for a job at the company.

Her name is Michelle and during her interview Rick systematically insults her. Later while hanging with Duke at a club, he bumps into her there as she is his waitress. Even there he insults her until she can't take it any more. She curses the son of a bitch and quits her job. At this point forward, the curse is set in place. Rick is challenged through several series of shocking turn events that involve an old college buddy who is a hit man and Rick's daughter, Eve.

From the Opera, Eve would be represented as Rigoletto's daughter Gilda. Same as from the Opera except changed around in the film for a more modern setting, Eve is seduced by Duke through cyber sexing sessions she has with him. At first the knowledge of Duke being her father's boss doesn't become known until one night Rick bumps into him while having dinner with his daughter and Rick slips out Duke's nickname 'Big Boss'. Big Boss is the handle that Duke uses for cyber sexing. This intrigues Eve and as a result she's invited to the big Christmas Party where Duke plans to fuck her silly, but to Duke he believes he's about to bang Rick's wife. How disappointed he will be.

Eve, sadly, believes herself to be doomed. She mentions it constantly in the film.  She's one of those girls who get so affected by losing one's mother or father that they act out in ways that are self destructive. It's understandable, but her doom is due in part by her own father's doing. I won't spoil it, but if you've ever read about the Opera for which this film is based than you'll probably know what had happened to poor Gilda. Same here befalls poor Eve. 

This all may be very disturbing or dark, it is, but there are small moments between Rick and his daughter that are tragic and are probably the only time you can connect with Rick himself. The death of his wife could be the reason why he is the way he is and now that she's gone, well, nothing seems to matter any more to him. Not even being nice. The writer of 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' penned this charming yuletide nightmare and he needs to KEEP writing stuff like this! The direction is handled well by Curtiss Clayton and the cast from Bill Pullman, Agnes Bruckner and Aaron Stanford did a splendid job.

So in the spirit of the holiday season, try to be naughty, cruel to your fellow man and have any piece of emotion that will require feelings to be tossed in the fireplace of burning hopes and desires.<>I've been a fan of Bill Pullman since Spaceballs. An underrated actor with a talent for both comedy and drama. This is one of his darkest movies. Some edgy plot twists. Nothing is as it seems. Great supporting cast.<>The only reason I rented this was because of Daniel Handler, whose Lemony Snicket books I love, and Bill Pullman who I find a very unique and interesting actor. Having said that, I found this film pretty hard to like, but I suppose it's meant to be that way. I thought the message of how surrounding yourself with corruption and cruel, disgusting people can turn you into one of them was interesting, but overall I just didn't care for the film that much. The ending was excellent, but the dark, dirty tone throughout most of the film is uncomfortable and a bit off-putting.<>Rick is an asshole who deserves what he's about to get after humiliating an asian woman who was just wanting a job. In the interview he systematically leads her on and insults her. When he goes to a club, she happens to be his waitress and he still insults her again. This time she doesn't take it anymore and puts a curse on him. Also there's Rick's daughter Eve, who has cyber sex with Rick's much younger boss, Duke, played by Aaron Stanford. When Rick and Eve go to a business party Duke assumes that Eve is Rick's wife and immediately wants to bang her and does. I don't want to spoil too much, but it's sad to what else also happens to Eve. I'll just leave it at that. Also there's Buck, Rick's College buddy who has his own business: Killing business competitors. I thought that was funny. He's played by Dylan Baker. He does a good job. They all did an excellent job at being rotten. With the acting aside, I must also praise the cinematography which looked beautiful. Don't expect to like the story of this film because it's not something to like. It is however a film of cruel, backstabbing and loathsome characters which I couldn't care for except to feel glad I wasn't them. So, when you're watching this film just feel thankful that you're not like Rick.<>A very strange movie that always keeps you guessing.  Superbly shot and acted, this is an extremely under-appreciated film.  It's unsettling to watch, and yet very compelling.  You are never really sure how to feel about any of the characters, and you have no idea what they are going to do from moment to moment.  No movie takes chances like this one.

From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live--and hunt--alongside humans all over the world.

My issue is that this doesn't feel like a apocalyptic scenario that it should be<>Most of the sins of Jurassic World Dominion would be forgivable if the movie were more fun.<>Jurassic World: Dominion is the worst thing to happen to the dinosaurs since that meteor 65 million years ago. This is how a franchise dies. With raptor-less applause.<>A disappointing end to something that could've been great, and hopefully the last we'll see of the franchise for a while - until they can come up with something really new.<>Jurassic World Dominion succeeds because of the nostalgia of seeing Dr. Settler, Dr. Grant, and Dr. Malcolm working together again, but ultimately their storyline does nothing to improve upon the ideas presented in Jurassic World. <>At one point Dr. Sattler, viewing the majesty of the replicated dinosaurs, says, ""You never get used to it.""

[Full review in Spanish]","I really liked it Chris Pratt is great to watch as always and how can you complain about dope dinosaur scenes what other franchise offers that's, I think people need to take it for what it is , this isn't the 80s , it's a action Dino movie and it delivers a lot of edge of our seat scenes. I thought it was a lot of fun isn't that what movies are about?<>The movie was supposed to be about dinosaurs... yet there were barely any at all. Firstly, they bring back the main cast, purely for fan service as they provide nothing additional towards the plot. Introducing another big company like Biosyn was a mistake. The least they could have done was bring back Ingen. The movie basically reversed all that happened in the last movie. The dinosaurs set free into the world ended up becoming money grabs again, and slapped back into another park. Supposed to be centered around the idea of 'coexistence' (as expressed by the opening monologue) yet there was no progress or development of that throughout the movie. Humans and dinosaurs ended up coexisting regardless of the events that went down in the film. Watch only the opening scene and the final scene, and you would miss no narrative from the middle... as there was no provided reason or progress towards coexistence. NOW, what was the entire plot of the movie if not to be about coexistence? BUGS... FUCKING BUGS! A dinosaur movie with the main complication being bugs... maybe (a very slight maybe) they could have made it work... BUT THEY DIDN'T! The plot felt so irrelevant to the whole movie's suggested idea of coexistence and really didn't make it interesting whatsoever. The whole main characters' quest relied on luck - meeting Kayla randomly in a bathroom and being lucky enough that she has access to the Biosyn facility. And what was her reason for helping you... because she felt bad? She risked her whole career for someone she just met? So she ends up helping them (hooray!) but on their way in they eject Claire from the plane? For what reason... to put her into more danger into pterosaur infested air... great plot movie. But then her escape didn't even feel necessary once Kayla and Owen SOMEHOW SURVIVED THE PLANE CRASH! Honestly, the characters in this movie find so many ways to survive. Maybe Claire should have stayed in the plane after all... But now she decides to wander off from the potentially safe tree that she ended up in (after being stupidly ejected from the plane), right into the dinosaur filled forest. AND SHE SURVIVES! This movie is the epidemy of stupendously horrible writing. Apart from all the stupid plot points... it still has no impact on the issues/theme addressed during the opening monologue - coexistence. Watch the beginning and the end and you will miss no important narrative. The entire movie was a waste... a wasted opportunity to close off this franchise... wasted opportunity of the characters... and a wasted opportunity after bringing back the original cast. Horrible send off to the entire series!<>Essentiality the Jurassic series is meant to themed around dinosaurs yet this movie even fails to do that. First, bringing back the cast was purely for fan service and provided not plot value. This movie was clearly just a cash grab with no real thought or relevance to the old original Jurassic Park/World movies. For example they should of named the company Ingen like the former movies not Biosyn. Also the fact that that one of the main plots of the movie regarded mutant bugs is so stupid giving this is a dinosaur movie. This movie seems muddled as there is not a really strong clear plot. It is all stung together with weak characters and weak plot. An absolutory awful movie that should not ever gross the amount of money that it did. An insult to the Jurassic franchise given what could be made with the budget if real thought and care went into the movie.<>Enjoyable watch that, while delivers a scattershot plot at best, also brings the cast from the old and new series together along with some fun action sequences.  Bringing the original cast back to work with the new ones was an inspired idea, though you don't see that happen till the third act.  Nevertheless, all the actors have fun in their roles, bringing  nice, nostalgic film.  Behind the camera, director Collin Trevorrow returns for some fun action (the Malta sequence is a standout) but a a plot that is all over the place.  Worst of all, it doesn't play off the potential of the ending of ""Fallen Kingdom"", which was supposed to show a world where dinosaurs now live in modern times.  It's hinted at a few times but gets sidetracked over genetic research, making you forget this is a dinosaur move at times.  Nevertheless, a fun watch, especially on a streaming service.<>A bit overhated, it's not great but it's decent. Fun, enjoyable moments some jump scares that got me. But there are some major flaws.<>All of the ingredients were there but it was a poorly executed movie. The way it was directed felt like a hallmark action flick.

It is filled with the most shallow scenes ever: it seemed as if the director forcefully told the actors to be as superficial as possible throughout the movie.

That's it. The identities of the youth and adult's does not matter here (we don't know the names of them, there they came from... nothing really). The only thing we know is they are shown as pretentious yet always looking for their primitive desire's and escapism from adulthood.

    Film start's with rather prolonged opening shot's of random (some say pretty) location's in Los Angeles. It feels like these shots might have been in the movie later or at least somewhere close (I said it's in LA) and it does not make you feel in any way. The purpose of these shot's might have been like a notification what you will have later: random pretentious teen's seeking leisure in boredom like you watching this. But it felt somewhat weak opening which does not really make you want to watch further of this movie. It might have been an attempt to describe a movie's emptiness and intellectualism and compare it to the character's in the movie, which certainly was not a focus point.

    The actor's felt like sometimes unprofessional and sometimes purposely unprofessional friends who tried to hang around with nothing else to do. All the movie feel's like that and the plot just desire's not to be explained.

    The strong aspect of this movie is the camera work and the atmosphere it makes. Sometimes I thought it was really set in the 90's and I forget about the actual fact that it was written ""2014"" near the name. And it would be really great because even the most professional modern-nostalgia movie's never actually feel that way as this movie would feel if, again, actor's. Actually director might be more guilty for not telling the actor's what to do. Because the manner's obviously changed in the decade's (at least this movie show's that).

    Definitely one of the best scene's in the movie was the teacher wandering in the beach and trying to explain why everybody actually need's holiday. It will probably grab the most of the attention and somebody could really tell it steal's the movie. It make's the movie rather purposeful because it defines the idea of escaping job and what we actually think about it. It can be interpreted in a lot of way's but mostly agreeable. 

    Overall, most of the aspect's (including music) feels mediocre, yet fun and fresh, and confusing. It feel's like an original comedy and attempt to be something meaningful what's not fully explained (at least for me). I don't think it desires to know what it is and yet fully achieves what it want's to be... Still comedy and overall style make's it a pleasant watch.",,,$2.4K,,,,,

Leeds,,"Feb 12, 2008",1h 15m,Detective Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) goes to Paris and solves the murder of a munitions magnate.,"Sidney Toler, Lynn Bari, Richard Clarke, Harold Huber, Dorothy Tree, Lon Chaney Jr., Leo G. Carroll, Noel Madison, Herbert I. Leeds",This was one of the poorer Charlie Chan episodes.,"Charlie seems virtually somnambulant here as personified by Sidney Toler.  Perhaps this is because he is overshadowed by Harold Huber who is way way way over the top as a comedic French assistant prefect of police.  Or perhaps it is because he realizes that WWII is about to break out.  Indeed, the film explicitly mentions Chamberlain's visit to Hitler after the takeover of Czechoslovakia and the mystery revolves around the death of a munitions smuggler in Paris (working for the other side).  So, it is a particularly sombre affair and the comic relief is a bit too heavy-handed.  Still, this series somehow will always take me away from any real problems I might face, at least temporarily.<>""Beware of spider who invites fly into his place for tea""--City in darkness...serious crime at play!!<>1.5: Hmm.  I was prompted to watch these by an article in The New Yorker that I read a year or two ago.  I wasn't expecting them to be outstanding, but I was expecting something better than this.  I have now seen essentially every Charlie Chan film, or at least all that were made between 1931 and 1947 (29 films).  What struck me most is that these really have more in common with a television show than a feature film.  Each film is essentially the same except for the ""location.""  I guess it makes sense as they serve essentially the same purpose.  One can essentially watch every film on auto-pilot comfortable in the knowledge that one knows exactly which characters will pop up and that everything will be satisfactorily resolved in the end.  They are ""C"" picture at best.  Sidney Toler is pretty good; Warner Toland is somewhat acceptable; and the other two one picture no-names are either inconsequential or awful.  It is rather ludicrous that they didn't allow an actual Asian actor to play the role, but the portrayal of African-American's is much more heinous.  They certainly pale in comparison to just about every other detective picture/TV series I've ever seen.  None of the films rate an individual review so this will have to suffice for all 29.<>Charlie Chan is in Paris just before the war, and Paris is in Darkness because of it's fear of being bombed! What better time to commit murder! A munitions shipper is bumped off, and suspects galore abound. Aided by a bumbling french police chief, Chan looks for clues and weeds out suspects. A few problems in this one.. Too much humor given to the police chief, and none of Chan's children make an appearance, which weakens this. Seems Toler was phoning this one in.<>Normally I really like Charlie Chan films.  This one I could not get into at all.  

It started out awkward, if that makes any sense.  It is not like the typical Charlie Chan formula.  It was too war based.  If I wanted to see a war movie, I would have rented one.  

Carlie's number two son, Jimmy was not in it either.  I really look forward to seeing Victor Sen Yung in the Sidney Toler version of Charlie Chan films.

Try another one instead.<>A little blander than most in the Charlie Chan series, but it's still good and worth watching.Interesting that it was set in Paris during the Munich crisis black-out in 1938.

The film makes some poignant statements through its likeable main character and a well-written script.  The writers do a good job of introducing seemingly insignificant characters and events that become important later in the film.  Khaled El Nabawy delivers a nice performance as he carries the film from start to finish.  I will admit, the line delivery is sometimes overly cheesy and the acting isn't anything to write home about, but the film achieves its goal by bringing attention to the unfair discrimination against innocent Arabs.  The highlight of the film is Cary Elwes' portrayal of the immigration lawyer as he delivers an impassioned monologue in defense of the main character.  While I wouldn't rank this film above average, it is definitely worth watching for its important moral lesson.<>3rd time posting this review-grrrr<>Not the best movie, could have been much better...!<>You should really see this movie.

Not that Two Women is a bad film.<>Rendering an astounding performance as a young widow in Vittiro De Sica's bleak neo-realistic WWII drama, Italian Sophia Loren became the first actress to (deservedly) win the Oscar for a role in a foreign-language film.<>A powerful experience to behold, and one of De Sica's finest films.<><>A bleak but powerful anti-war drama.<><>Staggering story, outstanding acting, particularly Loren.","Very well done, outstanding movie. Sophia Loren is wonderful.<>A war drama from a widowed mother's perspective seems like a very complex and tense film yet it is very well executed. That is Vittorio De Sica's film Two Women as it tells the story of a widowed mother (played by Sophia Loren) who tries to protect his daughter's innocence from the horrors of war. Sophia Loren who has starred in films in the past like Attila and Houseboat puts on a very daring and wonderful performance in Two Women. The costume designs in the film were pretty authentic for my taste. What is very nuanced and tense for this film was the film's cinematography by Gábor Pogány because of a certain scene in this film that became the turning point. All because that scene alone changed the atmosphere of the film. Two Women is a very poignant, heartbreaking, daring, and brilliant film.<>Sophia Loren ""was created differently, behaved differently, affected me differently from any woman I have known,"" Two Women director/writer Vittorio De Sica once said. ""I looked at that face, those unbelievable eyes, and I saw it all as a miracle.""

Given the starring role in Two Women, Sophia Loren delivered the first Best Actress Oscar ever given for a performance in a foreign-language film.<>De Sica's look at Rome, Italy, and the outlying regions, at the very end of WW2, is fascinating for that aspect alone, a sort of window into history. But the earthy, down-to-the-gutter performance by Sophia Loren raises the stakes considerably as a loving mother leading her oblivious daughter through dangerous straits, times, and men of war. Worthwhile.<>I saw this film years ago and never forgot it. It is brutal and tender.<>The lead performance is all it has going for it.<>Director: Vittorio De Sica Writers: Alberto Moravia (novel), Cesare Zavattini (adaptation) Stars: Sophia Loren, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Raf Vallone, Eleonora Brown

A moving, WWII Italian neorealist film . Sophia Loren's performance is astoundingly good. As is Eleonora Brown who plays her daughter,""Rosetta"". Loren deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar This film is about the ravages of war and what it does to an entire people but it concentrates on a mother and twelve year old daughter who have lost the ability to interact with one another but find it again after their shared tragedy. It's an extremely powerful film that leaves you worn out from your emotional bond with Loren, becoming the first performer to win an Oscar in a non-English role.

Unquestionably, this is a emotional and compelling film, showing the will of ""Two Women"" who struggle In the aftermath of the Second World War. A fine example of what Italian cinema has contributed to an international audiences. Superb Italian film. 9/10<>The disturbingly heartwrenching sequence of a mother and her daughter mass raped during Marocchinate in Vittorio De Sica's Italian World War II tragedy impels the Academy to bestow Sophia Loren the honour to be the first actress to win an Oscar for a performance in a foreign language film.<>I had always known Sophia Loren more as a sex symbol in films like Marriage Italian Style (1964) and Houseboat (1958) but here she gives a dramatic performance that even earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1961. While I don't think she earns the award, I would have given it to Geraldine Page for her spellbinding performance in Summer and Smoke (1961), I was impressed by how much emotional depth she brings to this role even as she was rather over dramatic at some points. The film as a whole is rather forgettable as it mostly serves a vehicle for Loren's performance and does not bring to life the time and place it is set in with the vibrancy deserving of wartime Italy.

Fiery Italian widow Cesira, Sophia Loren, lives with her innocent daughter Rosetta, Eleonora Brown, in Rome at the beginning of WWII. She leaves the city after having sex with her husband's friend Giovanni, Raf Vallone, and a dangerous bombing. They head towards her hometown of Ciociaria but encounter difficulties along the way as they witness the horrors of warfare. When they arrive in town Cesira strikes up a flirtation of sorts with the revolutionary Michele Di Libero, Jean-Paul Belmondo, who tries to take care of her and her daughter but is forced to leave when he is forced by German soldiers to serve as a guide for them to another area. The two women decide to venture back to Rome after some time but as they are heading back they are found by some Moroccan soldiers and raped which leaves Rosetta depressed and traumatized. The two eventually return to their traditional roles as they are united in their grief for Michele.

Loren is able to give her character a sense of deep felt strength as we understand in just a few moments that she has suffered a lot in her life and has been strengthened by these traumatizing experiences. To me it was not her relationship with her daughter but with her love interest that allowed Loren to display her abilities as an actress most. She plays flirtatious well, as you would expect from Loren, but she is also capable of showing how this character feels that she needs to display restraint due to her past with men. When she steps away from going too far with this man who may be untrustworthy Loren makes her character's actions understandable instead of painting her as a shrew or a minx. Her balancing of these various different personalities within one character are what make the performance a revelation even as I felt that she went too far at times.

The issue with the film is that certain parts of it feel too much like they are painted in broad strokes as scene of innocent but tough women facing off against the brutishness of warfare were more memorable in Rome, Open City (1945) and Mrs. Miniver (1942). There aren't really any images in this film that will stay in my mind after seeing it and the love between the mother and daughter did not feel as intense as it should have which made it a bit of a disappointment. I want to like war films but I often find it difficult to connect with them because they feature all male casts portraying characters who can seem unsympathetic but unfortunately this was not the film to show me the female perspective. A film like Since You Went Away (1944) is very good at providing you with an example of the female perspective on war and the attachments that women have to the men in their lives and their precious daughters. I would recommend watching films made in the 1940s that deal with how war effected the lives of people living in small towns going through their day to lives instead of watching this unmemorable film.

Loren might not be a ‘great' actress but she proves that she has capabilities beyond showing off her ample bosoms, stunning facial features and impossibly thin waist in this film and that may be appealing to some who may have been hoping for more from a very famous but not particularly respected performer.<>Sophia Loren's towering performance as she plays a young widow trying to survive and protect her young daughter from the insanity of war in 1943 Italy.",Carlo Ponti,"May 9, 1961 original",,Embassy Pictures,,,,

Andrew McCarthy - Jack -  maintains a lot of his 80s charm in this movie, which centers around his life in real estate/business contracting. The specifics are a little fuzzy, but it seems like he is charged with executing contracts that relate to commercial real estate. His firm's CEO is also the father of Jack's steady gal, played by the camera-genic Stephanie Mills. As expected, Stephanie is a handful; she is over-confident, pushy, and can't wait to get a ring from Jack. 
Jack has a lot riding on his charm, so he turns to something that he thinks will up his chances of overall success with Stephanie and her dad: dance lessons. 
The lessons will be just another tick on his running tab of charisma to keep in the good graces of his future family. (But: my one thought was not really knowing why he felt the need to do that; even if he had a promotion pending, it is so clear that the CEO Fam loves him.)

The dance lessons: This is the best part. The serene and elegant Michelle Nolden (Christine), evidently a dancer in real life, is his instructor. He comes in with a little bit of a 'teach me dance in one afternoon!' mentality, but she won't accept anything less than deep devotion to her art. He quickly adapts and earns her respect. 

His mom (Jack's) is very quirky, motherly, and the movie really plays up the Mom stereotypes: she's a little frumpy, very frugal, naggy, pushy, and her son's #1 fan. She vies for him to stay strong in his pursuit of married life with Demi (Stephanie Mills).

The conflict is: His employer (Demi's fathers') firm is shutting down the dance studio. Christine's realization of this creates a mental break, practically, and she stops at nothing to uncover a solution. It isn't until much further into the movie that the 'betrayal' of his firm's plans is clear to Christine and she naturally holds it against Jack. 
She can't get the funds on her own to support a buyout, and worst of all, this studio reminds her of her parents, who built it and are no longer alive. 
But all is not lost...

This is where you get to watch the rest. (As if there is any mystery; after all, this is Hallmark!)
Acting: Believable, esp. from the main characters.

Character notes: I did not care much for his (Jack's) best buddy from work, who was overacting his role as the empty vessel of a guy he intended to be. Additionally, I thought the older man who plays Christine's dance studio helper/maintenance guy was just too darn friendly. (if he looked more like a teddy-bear grandpa, perhaps it would not have been a big deal, but he seemed more like a Sopranos cast-off)

The ages of the main actors were perfect; I can't imagine the pairing having more chemistry, even Stephanie Mills who was so fun to watch.

The whole movie was a joy to see; if you love dancing, check out the Samba (rumba?) scene with the guest couple; these were not dance amateurs! Make a sequel, Hallmark!",Marek Posival,,,,TVG,,Dolby Digital,

However, when Carl reawakens, Alex quickly realizes he cannot control the crazed cyborg he has engineered.","Richard Cox, Teri Austin, Pam Grier, David McIlwraith, Maury Chaykin, Catherine Disher, Stephen Mendel, Jean-Claude Lord",A few promising ideas are unfortunately dwarfed by the horrendous acting and ridiculous soundtrack.,"A modern-day retelling of the classic Frankenstein story set in the 80s — I mean, the movie is also known as Frankenstein 2000 as Frankenstein 80 was already taken and Joe D'Amato didn't make Frankenstein 2000: Return from Death until 1992 and he wouldn't care if he stole a movie title — The Vindicator was made in Canada and directed by Jean-Claude Lord (who also directed Visiting Hours as well as Toby McTeague the very same year).

The ARC corporation is trying to make the spacesuit of the future which will have a rage mode that takes over the wearer's mind when they need to survive a dangerous situation, going pretty much full-on rage mode. Why this would be part of the machine is something that I leave up to you, dear viewer. That's the same question that scientist Carl Lehman has, particularly after some monkeys die when one of the bosses, Alex Whyte, cranks them monkeys up to eleven and lets God or whatever machine logic that runs our simulation play dice. Dead monkeys lead to dead scientist which leads to Project Frankenstein, which is sort of RoboCop a year early.

I kind of like how filmmakers say they're doing a modern Frankenstein and instead of being somewhat coy and naming the robot Project Prometheus or Project Shelley, they sledgehammer the point home and just say, ""Hey smart guy, it's just called Project Frankenstein, OK?""

If you wonder, ""Will something go wrong, sending monkeys in a rage and burning Carl's new skin off and him going on a quest to find his wife, who is played by the actress who would be Jill Bennett on Knot's Landing?,"" then the answer is, of course, yes.

But hey — this also has Pam Grier as Hunter, a hitman who needs a challenge and that usually involves liquidating anyone who knows or sees or even thinks about Carl in the suit. He's never called the Vindicator, but hey I know one other Canadian scientist who got burned alive inside his cyborg suit and that'd be Weapon Alpha or the Guardian or Vindicator from John Byrne's Alpha Flight and Canadians may be too polite to vindicate but I do not believe they are so polite as not to steal a movie title.

Anyways, there are some cyborg zombie battles and Carl's colleague Burt trying to cuck him from beyond the grave and umbilical tubes being used to drown people and much like the cover of the VHS, I'm making this all sound way more exciting than it is. But isn't that what renting movies used to be all about? You see a title like The Vindicator and a flaming cyborg — much less one designed by Stan Winston — and you say, ""Gimme that.""

More of a revenge-horror film with a facade of a Frankenstein-type theme (fyi, it was originally known as Frankenstein 88 and later in some countries as Frankenstein 2000 [the D'Amato movie released in the US under that name has no relation]), it appears to have been marketed as a Terminator rip-off. It may also be seen a loose blue-print for Robocop and also has aspects remnicent of the earlier Swamp Thing and the later Darkman.

""If I Had My Way is a 1940 musical comedy film directed by David Butler and starring Bing Crosby and Gloria Jean. Based on a story by David Butler, the film is about a construction worker who takes charge of the daughter of a fellow worker killed in an accident. After bringing the girl to New York to find her uncle, who has spent his life savings on a failed restaurant, he tries to help the girl and her uncle make the restaurant a success.""--wikipedia

A serious contender for waste of time. While some might call this a sweet melodrama, it wasn't anything but a disappointment for me.  I never thought Bing could get stuck with a lemon, but in my opinion he did in this one.

An orphaned girl is helped by Bing to get to her relatives, but they don't want her.  Bing manages to fool the rich relatives by using their greed to believe in worthless stock.

This one was tough to get through, too silly in many scenes although the beginning did have promise.

 Lackluster Crosby musical. 



NOTES:

1   Upon the film's recent DVD release, DVD Talk praised Crosby and thought Jean was cute, but criticized the plot and called the film ""strictly second-run material"".

2   Reviewers in 1940 had kind words for Bing and Gloria, but complained about the timeworn storyline.

It's clunky and wordy, and looks like something you made with your friends at school, but it has a quality that just about manages to shine through. Great wank scene.<>zombies can't masturbate. interesting departure from the typical zack piece though.<>Achingly slow minimalist zom tale follows a man's gradual transformation into the title creature after sustaining a bite from an infected gal.

Not a bad premise. Sadly, the creators, so focused on creating a ""thinking man's"" zom flick, have made something more akin to a stuffy art school project than anything disturbing or horrifying (we're about one weeping clown eating pasta in a bathtub away from being unwatchably pretentious).

If being mind-numbingly boring wasn't enough, we're also treated to heaps of ""deep"" introspective voice-overs, moody masturbation scenes, distractingly poor f/x (save for the finale) and a lead character whom we're to believe is highly intelligent, yet makes incredibly stupid decisions (presumably to keep the story afloat).

For example, when this guy comes across what appears to be a diseased, rotting, blood and pus-covered crack whore doing the funky chicken in an abandoned house in the woods, he scoops her up, gets that pizza-face within chompin' distance of his and carries her like a groom with a bride 'cross the threshold.

Bottom line, the makers deserve two stars for the unique premise, but, if you're looking for a low-budget, unique and disturbing take on the walking dead, skip this and check out The Zombie Diaries.<>While a good idea in concept, this movie just about fails on every level. You'd think a simple story about the transformation into zombiehood would yield better results. This, for some reason, is more of an art film with way too many scenes of the zombie staring off into the distance while piano music played. Oh well, at least I got the chance to see that zombie's do masturbate..<>Interesting contemporary zombie story, rather brutally graphic, but it is an unusual twist on the often told subject. Very good score, nicely acted and directed. Good pace.<>I, Zombie makes an early stab at a theme that would be quite popular in the most recent slate of zombie films.  It's most clear descendants are movies like American Zombie, Zombie Honeymoon, and Zombies Anonymous.  All three films follow I, Zombie's lead in thinking about what it would be like to  be a conscious zombie.  In some ways, this film explores that issue more intimately than do the later films.

The film follows Brian, a graduate student who gets bitten by a zombie and finds himself turned into one.  He has an uncontrollable hunger for people and is slowly rotting as he hides away from the world.  It's a grim tale of desperation and sorrow, with lots of lingering shots focused on Brian's painful life hiding in his flat. A few other thoughts:

    * While the film contemplates the question of what it would be like to become a zombie quite well, it veers quite far from the recipe necessary for an enjoyable zombie film.  There's not much tension as Brian never seems in any sort of danger.  A persistant detective (ala Zombie Honeymoon) would have made the story a bit more exciting.
    * The gloomy desperation and haunted narrative reminds me a lot of An American Werewolf in London, which also considers the spiritual tragedy of becoming a monster.
    * This movie has one of the more horrifying consequences of rotting I've seen in a zombie film, made much worse by the emotional depth of the scene in which it occurs.
    * There's not a whole lot of action or excitement in the film.  Instead, its matter-of-fact cinematography and shallow narrative arc short circuit most of the horror-pleasure that one finds in these films.  In so doing, I could see it being pretty unsatisfying for people looking for more conventional fare.  That said, I think it makes a fine companion to those other films I mentioned above.
    * The makeup effects and dream sequences are impressive and solid.

Overall, it's worth seeing, but  more recent films do the same work in a more entertaining way.<>The pace of this is so very slow.  That being said I still remember this movie 9 years later, so it did strike a cord and stuck in y brain.  This movie is about 1 man who gets bit by a zombie and slowly slowly slowly turns (like I said, the pace is slow).  But it was a pretty good new take on zombie-ism.  The man starts to shut down and fall apart and tries to put himself back together.  His leg breaks, so he tries to keep it together with a metal plate, ext.  In the end he's slowly falling away as he clutches for his humanity.  It's really pretty sad.  This is not your typical zombie action flick, but it did stick in my mind, so it can't be that bad :)<>I am going to warn you right now: should you ever become a zombie, do not attempt to masturbate. Thank you.<>Really sad and pesimistic movie, but it's original, a good change for zombie fans",,,,,,,,

IMO Rourke is the best actor of his generation, his no bullshit style and pure emotional depth has you lost in his world.
He puts in an amazingly underrated performance here,  short on words but full of scared wisdom as a brooding seen it all carefree drifter and he remains magnetising throughout this barely seen neo western classic.
What's impressive is the beautifully shot scenery and its ability to take its time, no rushing only added intensity when needed, much like the main characters.
Lori Singer & Peter Berg also turn in top notch performances.

That said...Hidden Blade twists the story too many times that it begins to buckle under itself.<>The handsome noir skillfully makes its ideological crash (and inevitably propagandistic bent) part of the confounding atmosphere, shrouding it in smoke, food, mirrors and sake.<>Gorgeous and empty.<>""Hidden Blade,"" a stylish, nonlinear exercise in Chinese film noir, is one of those movies where, at first, you're not exactly sure where it's going or what anyone's doing. But, boy, do they look great doing it.<>An otherwise atmospheric and moody period piece, Hidden Blade always seems to undercut its strengths and delivers a middling spy film that never quite scratches below the surface.<>On a purely aesthetic basis, this is a slick and handsomely made production.<>To attempt to follow the plot of Hidden Blade is difficult and, essentially, a fool's errand.<>I found the whole ""Hidden Blade"" rather less satisfying than its component parts. The many characters, myriad plot points and points of view and added complications with the timeline just clutter things up.<>However crisp and stylishly executed, the parts don’t quite add up to a satisfying whole.<>While it is eminently watchable, it’s a movie that consists of mostly people sitting at tables with fantastic period clothing plotting and scheming, but sometimes barely moving at all.<> Visually stylish, well-edited and intelligent spy thriller, but also somewhat dry, tedious and exhausting.<>It’s absorbing cinema. And even with its not-so-hidden nationalistic bend, its a beguiling spy thriller with a stylishly sumptuous genre veneer.<>Hidden Blade walks the line between art film and commercial extravaganza. The end result is a spectacle movie with a focus on story. Though director Er Cheng gets the tone right, there are some awkward moments. 

<>Cheng Er seems to have studied Tarantino, Hong Kong and Korean cinema quite thoroughly and the result is a truly exceptional spy thriller that thrives equally on visuals, acting and overall atmosphere. 

","I love this movie. When you pay more attention to details, you will find it charming !<>Story line is very appealing. All actors are really fascinating. You can feel the tense. The music is very very great.<>You will love it when you find the details hidden behind the scenes. Every character has a story and is considerable. Actions are very good. The conversation is meaningful.

A shining example of auteur cinema, excellent casting and meticulous lighting Abe created a noir experience worthy of a few watches.

I love it!<>the director was in love with his shots and thinking his bouncing around in the timeline was clever. it got old and honestly I couldn't really get over the horrible bit with the dog near the start<>Thought provoking intriguing plot and for history buffs especially fascinating- superb actors<>This movie is superb. Theatrically and esthetically pleasing. Each frame is perfectly shot and beautifully composed. Storytelling is like putting together puzzle pieces with suspense. It kept you guessing. All the actors did an amazing job, especially the young and upcoming actor Wang Yibo. He put on a confident performance alongside very experienced actors like Tony Leung and Zhou Xun. He portrayed and expressed the complicated and internally turmoiled character with surprising maturity. Wang Yibo is definitely a rising movie star to track. While the movie is 2 hours long, it didn't feel that way at all. There was never a dull moment. You will continue to chew on this film long after you watch it, and you would want to watch it again and enjoy the process of solving a beautifully composed puzzle. Well done!<>I think it is the best art-house film in Chinese history, and the young actor Yibo Wang is very surprised<>Highly recommended! I like the background music, the designs of the scenes, and the way all the plots are waved as a story. All the main characters look gorgeous in their costumes, of whom (both ladies and gentlemen), the young spy is the most beautiful. Ms. Ye (played by Wang Yibo) has pretty face, nice skin, and good figure, so charming especially when he acted in the two fightings!

Lewis","May 19, 2009",1h 54m,"This acclaimed thriller stars Jane Fonda as Bree Daniel, a New York City call girl who becomes enmeshed in an investigation into the disappearance of a business executive. Detective John Klute (Donald Sutherland) is hired to follow Daniel, and eventually begins a romance with her, but it appears that he hasn't been the only person on her trail. When it becomes clear that Daniel is being targeted, it's up to her and Klute to figure out who is after her before it's too late.","Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Roy Scheider, Charles Cioffi, Dorothy Tristan, Rita Gam, Vivian Nathan, Nathan George, Morris Strassberg, Jean Stapleton, Barry Snider, Anthony Holland, Richard B. Shull, Alan J. Pakula, Andy Lewis, David P. Lewis, C. Kenneth Deland, Alan J. Pakula, Michael Small, Gordon Willis, Carl Lerner, Alixe Gordin, George Jenkins, John Mortensen, Ann Roth","That it succeeds is mostly due to Fonda. Calling her performance powerhouse would be a grand understatement.<>The film is meticulously made, offering a swirl of tension -- aided in this by Michael Small's haunting score -- and Fonda is indeed fantastic, even if the role she's playing happens to be a Hollywood staple of outdated moors.<>Like other of Pakula's greatest films featuring phenomenal female leads, this is really a Jane Fonda picture you're watching, and it's impossible to forget it<>Style, grit, and a narrative that pits focus on the unforgiving landscape of New York City.<>There is a timelessness to the freaky-ness and sadness of the human condition in this film, and Fonda is nothing short of sensational in her tense portrayal of a transitioning soul. An essential watch.<>As close to a classic as anything New Hollywood produced.<>Persuasive script by Andy and Dave Lewis; elegantly muted Technicolor; high in its class.<>What lifts it above its B-picture origins (and the pastiche is certainly conscious) is the style -- crisp, elliptical, only moderately arty -- of Alan J. Pakula's direction.<>This is done with remarkably little dialogue but with a tremendous sense of tension and atmosphere.<>But Klute feels vibrantly alive in a way that betrays its subdued chilliness.<>While the plot mechanics work along the well-worn gears of any number of mystery-thrillers, the film catches and holds us because Bree is such a fascinating, enigmatic character.<>Klute is a cool film about a cool customer, but it's all a façade... [I]t's more of a character study in thriller garb, and Bree's cool affect is mostly a well-honed act.<>There was no shortage of superb performances by lead actresses in the 1970s -- Diane Keaton in Annie Hall and Sally Field in Norma Rae are two that immediately come to mind -- but Jane Fonda's turn in Klute was not only great but also groundbreaking.<>A movie resolutely of its moment that still surges with third-rail electricity ...<>Playing a complex, sharpy written part, Jane Fonda won the Best Actress Oscar for her strongest dramatic performance in Alan Pakula's well mounted drmataic thriller<>Produced handsomely in New York, but directed tediously by Alan J. Pakula, the film is a suspenser without much suspense.<>One of the most important and influential movies of the early 1970s.<>[Fonda] makes all the right choices, from the mechanics of her walk and her voice inflection to the penetration of the girl's raging psyche. It is a rare performance.<>Sutherland is either an excellent sounding board for this nuanced portrait or he's a big zero, probably both. Fonda, however, transcends her limitations, making the most of her often forced quality as an actress.<>Fonda is simply a revelation, beautiful, sassy and streetwise, and yet hauntingly vulnerable. She deserved her Oscar in a role she has never bettered.","While it's the lowest film in terms of ranking in Alan J. Pakula's Paranoia Trilogy, that says nothing to the grittiness that Pakula and Jane Fonda provide in this haunting film. Donald Sutherland offers some consideration, but it's Jane Fonda's film for the most part.<>Klute showcases Jane Fonda at her utmost, where she gets completely into character and displays signs of both toughness and vulnerability. Donald Sutherland's rather dull character in contrast to Fonda's, somehow fits right into the puzzle. The script has so much to tell yet does it with so little dialogue, and a lot of directorial brilliance by Alan J. Pakula. The other members of the cast also exhibit great performances, mainly Roy Scheider and Charles Cioffi, who is assigned a great monologue around the end of the movie. This 70s cinema splendor is a must-see.<>They don't make films like this anymore. 70's nuanced filmmaking at its best. It's rare to see a film that explores human weakness, fragility or the inner psyche of a prostitute. There are complex character dynamics of love, hate, mistrust, sex and resentment between Donald Sutherland's character and Jane Fonda's character that drives the film. Along with a mysterious and dangerous villains that is seldom scene. This all creates atmosphere and tension, something that is solely missing from today's cinema landscape. No super hero CGI fights in this film.<>Alan J. Pakula's Klute is a tightly woven thriller that takes place in the dark shadows and the seedy underbelly of New York.  Klute (Donald Sutherland) is a private investigator hired to find a missing Pennsylvania business executive, the only clue being a hostile letter addressed to a call girl, Brie Daniels (Jane Fonda).  Thanks to Pakula's direction, it's an atmospheric and stylish film noir that features a wildly complex plot, a subdued but effective performance from Sutherland, an Oscar-winning performance from Fonda, and simmering suspense created via a great score in conjunction with lengthy takes.  Those used to the fast-paced thrillers of today will find it slow, but those willing to sit back and immerse themselves in the movie will be rewarded.<>Maybe I'm stupid but I didn't understand the entire thing... Fonda in those last few scenes however is particularly compelling and impressive. Donald Sutherland is also really good.<>In Alan Pakula's informal 'Paranoia Trilogy', Klute stands something of the odd film out; the other films, The Parallax View and All The President's Men are far more explicitly political and intense (for a thriller, Klute isn't all that thrilling). Instead of a twisted conspiracy against unseen forces, the film is very much street-level and straightforward, opting for tight human interaction to generate plot progression; notably, Pakula doesn't strive for perfection in the delivery, keeping takes with small hiccups in the delivery, actors talking over one another or awkardly fumbling when it serves the tone appropriately. The 'main' story is really secondary to the character development of Fonda's Bree, a streetwalker whose liberation, past traumas, and personal flaws are brought out in vivid detail by an exceptional performance; the investigation is more of a mechanism to peek beyond the veil of a character who has built up a wall around herself out of a sense of self-preservation. Fonda received the Oscar for Best Actress for her role here and delivers depth to a role that was clearly intended to subvert conventions regarding the 'hooker with a heart of gold' archetype and largely succeeds, as she feels like a real person with desires, shortcomings, and fears. However, the tell-all sessions with a psychiatrist feel a bit too on-the-nose; how are we supposed to know that her stoic facade is cracking with the onset of genuine affection if she doesn't say so explicitly to a character that is only there for exposition. Could use some more subtlety on that front, in my opinion.

Cioffi as the sadistic villain is well-cast in his brief supporting role, but feels under-explored, and what suspense is there feels largely manufactured by eery theramin music. The resolution is so low-stakes and passive as to feel almost insulting (spoiler: Cioffi's Cable hucks himself out a window at the first sign of potential conflict. All Klute has to do is walk into the room and it's suicide time). What we end up left with is a well-designed character study that happens to be paired with a particularly slow and pretty uninteresting thriller, high in its highs and low in its lows but still worthy of attention. (3.5/5)<>Early American Giallo that really had more emphasis on the tension rather than gore. Despite the filming, acting, music and cinematography, there is something slightly missing. Donald Sutherland is Klute, a detective looking for his friend who disappeared. He is lead to Jane Fonda's Bree Daniels, a call girl with a troubled past.<>Not sure why this is called Klute when really it should be called Daniels. To me it's a really nuanced and non-moralising examination of sex work, way ahead of its time and probably as subtle as anything that might be made now. Fonda is fantastic, as is Sutherland.<>Donald Sutherland is detective John Klute and stars next to Jane Fonda
Klute is assigned to a high-end call-girl named Bree Daniels, she's afraid for her life when a psycho killer is targeting several women like her 
An executive of many of her clientele goes missing for a year and a half which Klute knew 
Naturally he and Bree develop a romance with one another 
Yet she has a target on her back so they both have to find out who this killer is 
Fonda gets to have more range here in her early days; as this character she believes being a call-girl is like acting being that she plays a part, a fantasy, she doesn't have to feel anything feel powerless or controlled because the men she sees they just want something out of it if not her 
Her job is less taxing and humiliating 
But even Bree's therapist has no ""cure"" for her profession 
In her eyes being a sex object results in a more straightforward, clear-cut contract with the patriarchy and with men than struggling to be appreciated for her other talents 
She and Sutherland bounce amazingly off another 
It's amazing how Fonda had 3 husbands she outgrew, swore off men, protested climate change, wrote a book on environmentalism, and managed to speak her voice loud and clear
This role in particular has had the actress allowed herself to assert her independence as well as talking about the standards of feminism, women's beauty, and how the equality of women in Hollywood should be 
This movie is a slow chore to get through with a lot of talking but Fonda soars next to Sutherland as unlikely kindred spirits<>Jane Fonda is sensational as call-girl Bree Daniels in this chilling thriller that deserves all the praise it received. Though it has been fifty years since its inception, Klute goes to show that an eerie thriller can still be timeless in its own right.",Alan J.

It was a little different than I had imagined, but it was a nice little story to watch unfold.<>Predictable and cliched, and these are not characteristics typical of movies based on remarkable true stories.  One can only assume that the story was pressed through so many filters of production that they hoped it could squeeze into a Notebook-lite story.  One of the most tedious cliches is the good looking, ""all American"" soldier shown as a wise and worldly man, doing what needs to be done, contrasted with the silly hippies who are so naive for opposing war.  As a person with plenty of military in his family, I can assure you that soldiers are just as clueless as anyone else, and it's a dehumanizing trope to try to peg either stereotypes this way.

Production Dates: late September to mid-November 1952
Filmed in 1.37 to 1 aspect ratio
Released in 1.85 to 1 widescreen aspect ratio
The film marked Universal's first use of stereophonic sound, which at the time was presentable only in select theaters. Some contemporary reviewers complained that the sound, with its use of three speakers, was loud and distracting.
Originally planned to be photographed in 3-D
Most of the picture was shot in Morgan City, LA, and some scenes were shot in New Orleans and on an oil-drilling barge thirty miles out in the Gulf of Mexico
While filming scenes on location in Louisiana, Dan Duryea slipped and fell from the roof of a tugboat (which appears throughout the film). He suffered a broken rib, contusion and bruises, but was able to continue filming after a day or two of rest




The film is available as a standalone on VHS. Included in the James Stewart: Screen Legend Collection DVD box set (1.33:1 aspect ratio)

The subject: a young man, Fernando, on his way to live his sexual identity and find love.  I immediately found an access to Fernando's person. He portrays me as I felt and saw myself at the age of 18. Unfortunately, openly shown sexuality is too often misunderstood as offensive in films like this. But those sexual needs and facts are there. It's usually the wrong approach to make those needs disappear under any sheets or bed covers. I love this film because it shows tenderness.
Striking how touching the touches are. That longing for someone else's hand to hold. Paul Act as Fernando gives this character a vivid, true face. The development from the insecure, stranded visitor of a gay bar is stirring. In search of orientation. In images between dream and reality (a masterpiece of Leopoldo Laborde to tell the story this way). Fernando's search for understanding, friendship and love  towards Miguel. The questions, the uncertainty, the joy in his face that slowly develops whilst searching and having found a partner. Who after all also understands that it is a search for a loving partner. And who then really accepts Fernando. This development is reflected in the face of this young man (Paul Act shows a very natural acting talent in it), which touched me a lot in this film. It is on the same, high level as the French film ""Mit Siebzehn"" (original title: Quand on a 17 ans) by André Téchiné, shown at the Berlinale 2016. I am happy that there is finally a similarly honest portrayal of this QUEER topic on German television with the series ALL YOU NEED. For BOY UNDONE and especially the actors PAUL ACT and EDUARDO LONGORIA 10 points out of 10! I look forward to the next films with the two and by Leopoldo Laborde. 

BOY UNDONE Recuerdos de lo que no sucedió.
El tema: un joven, Fernando, en su viaje para vivir su identidad sexual y encontrar el amor.  Encontré un acceso inmediato a la persona de Fernando. Retrata cómo me sentía y me veía a mí mismo a los 18 años. Desgraciadamente, la sexualidad mostrada abiertamente se toma con demasiada frecuencia como algo ofensivo en películas como ésta. Pero esas necesidades y hechos sexuales están ahí. La mayoría de las veces, el enfoque equivocado es dejar que esas necesidades desaparezcan bajo las sábanas. Me encanta esta película porque muestra la ternura.
Llama la atención lo conmovedor de los toques. Ese anhelo de tomar la mano de otra persona. Paul Act como Fernando da a este personaje un rostro vivo y verdadero. La progresión del visitante inseguro y desamparado a un bar gay es conmovedora. En busca de orientación. En imágenes entre el sueño y la realidad (una obra maestra de Leopoldo Laborde para contar la historia de esta manera). La búsqueda de amor y amistad de Fernando con Miguel. Las preguntas, la incertidumbre, la alegría en su rostro que evoluciona lentamente mientras busca y encuentra un compañero que ama . Que al fin y al cabo, también entiende que se trata de una búsqueda de pareja amorosa. Y que luego acepta y abraza a Fernando. Esta evolución se refleja en el rostro de este joven (Paul Act muestra un talento interpretativo muy natural en él), que me emocionó mucho en esta película. Está al mismo nivel, alto, que la película francesa ""A los 17 años"" (título original: Quand on a 17 ans) de André Téchiné, que se presentó en la Berlinale 2016. Me alegro de que con la serie ALL YOU NEED haya por fin un retrato igual de honesto de este tema en la televisión alemana. Para BOY UNDONE y especialmente para los actores PAUL ACT y EDUARDO LONGORIA, 10 de 10 puntos! Ya estoy esperando las próximas películas de ambos y de Leopoldo Laborde.<>The movie did keep my attention, but I do not know why. My best guess is I kept waiting for something to happen. I waited a long time for the boys (young men) to display a bit of maturity.  With the film done and gone, I still do not know much more than the actors about what happened to cause the amnesia nor why the woman hated him.  So much for  queer cinema. I would have liked a bit of explanation. But, the boys did not seem to mind being left with unanswered questions.",,,,,,,,

[Full Review in Spanish]<>A lackluster sequel whose most redeeming quality is the noble presence of actress Michelle Yeoh.<>Its high-flying action lacks the distinctive elegance of its predecessor.<>Sword Of Destiny suffers endlessly by comparison to Ang Lee's groundbreaking 2000 film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, for the comparative smallness of its vision, its visuals, and its budget.<>Long-awaited martial-arts sequel more brutal than original.<>If grunge killed glam rock in the martial arts movie world, Sword of Destiny is a well-timed tribute band; you wouldn't want everyone to start wearing spandex again, but it's fun for a night.<>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is back after over a decade, but shows its age in this staler, more weightless martial arts meh-travaganza.","Not nearly as good as the first one. This is so bad. I can’t even write a review.<>The presence of Michelle Yeoh, Donnie Yen, JuJu Chan and the outstanding newcomer (she was new then, anyway) Natasha Liu Bordizzo can't save this film. Though this film was directed by the great Yuen Woo-ping, this was written by an American, scripted in English, edited by an American and filmed in New Zealand. The movie is a derivative cash-in and a far cry from its high-flying predecessor. There's a great teahouse fight where we meet Silent Wolf's warriors. That's all there is to see here. Watch on Netflix instead: the Ip Man films, The Paper Tigers, Fearless, The Twins Effect II<>we wanted a wushu movie, and we got.... kindof a wushu movie!? I have to admit it kept being hilarious to watch Harry Shum Jr stuck in a cage for 2/3 of the movie, and the story itself has all my favorite melodramatic twists and turns (no spoilers, I guess). Gave the occasional Orphan of Zhao vibes. The sort of in medias res-ness of the allegiances and groups was weird and annoying, as was the original English language, complete with depressing translations of names (this poor girl has to walk around as 'Snow Vase' for the whole movie?!)<>Ignore the first movie (try to).

Then just enjoy the fight sequences and acting.  There are some very talented actor s here.<>A disappointment This action is a pointless sequel but it's not terrible<>I'm glad it's nothing like it's predecessor. Who wants the same thing twice ? Instead, it's more like the wuxia movies of old, where strangers, with their unique skills, fight to defeat evil forces out of a sense of  righteousness. As usual,  Donnie Yen and Michelle Yeoh shine like the mega stars they are - after all, they're the real deal kung-fu masters. Harry Shum Jr surprisingly, breaks out of his Glee fame, and adds a much needed cheek to the otherwise very serious tone of the movie. A must-see for all wuxia fans.<>It tries to expand on the lore of its predecessor, but it fails miserably and ends up being a forgettable, lazy and unnecessary sequel that doesn't live up to the original's reputation because of its formulaic and unoriginal script, flat characters, unremarkable martial arts scenes filled with excessive slow-motion and underwhelming CGI, unfunny comic relief, messy tone, and a lack of authenticity and respect to the Chinese culture.<>What a crying shame. To go to all the trouble to make a sequel to what was seriously one of the best films of this genre of all time, only to bugger it up so monumentally.
I must have rewatched the fight scenes from the original Crouching Possum, Hidden Wombat 50 times or more, particularly the one with Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. These fight scenes are mechanical and boring. There's nothing particularly enjoyable here at all. 
They even CHANGED the SWORD... The hilt is different. WTF.
So in summary:
No real story
no drama at all
no good fight scenes
Almost no character depth.

Michelle Yeoh did any heavy lifting at all that was managed for this blight on our culture.<>Nice cinematography and Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Snow Vase was a fresh new face. But the original Academy Award version in 2000 feat. Zhang Ziyi was sooo much better!<>Amazing fight choreography and beautiful scenery...this alone is worth watching. I also enjoyed the theme of the ""iron way"" and the mystery behind some of the characters past history.

I must admit that I enjoyed watched the first movie more because the concept was fresh and i felt a stronger connection to the original cast of characters...in comparison, this sequel did not develop the various characters as strongly but it does a descent job continuing the storyline of the first movie. 

This is a must watch for me individuals who enjoy watching martial arts film. It's unfortunate to see many people Amazing fight choreography, good storyline from current plot and continuation from 1st movie. 

I have a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars because I found it a bit of a stretch to incorporate Donnie Yen's character as one of the men that Michelle Yeow also loved & had to choose between. Do yourself a favour and ignore other reviews...just go watch this movie and enjoy it for what it is!","Charlie Nguyen, Peter Berg",,,,PG-13 (Martial Arts Violence|Brief Partial Nudity),,,

Obviously there's no graphic rape scenes, but there is talk about it. 
(https://foreverfinalgirl.com/spit-your-grave-3/)<>If the writers intention was to portray a rape victims downward spiral into full blown psychosis they did a poor job of it. Almost everything about Jennifer's breakdown seemed forced and the dialogue consisted of soundbites and (macabre) bumper sticker philosophy. The movie left no room for ambiguity or nuance: men are at best ineffectual and worthless and at worst misogynistic monsters, and by the end of the movie the distinction has become so blurred as to be non-existent. A series that began as a vision of female empowerment loses its way so badly that by the end any sympathy I felt for Jennifer had dissipated. The screenplay doesn't allow us to relate to Jennifer in any way above the superficial or truly examine how disillusioned she has become, and instead of striking a blow for feminism ultimately serves only to demonize the protagonist who by the end has become the antagonist. Maybe the point of the movie was to show that the unbridled thirst for revenge, to quote John Ford, ""proves its own executioner"" but this is never sufficiently explored and maybe that's giving the writers credit where none is due, especially considering how insubstantial the plot and writing was.<>Much more clever and twisty than the predecessors and other revenge movies. This is a rather good commentary on rape culture.<>Its difficult to chew through. But in general most critics fail to realize the simple truth. 

If you look at the main character (mills) at the start of the first film (before the trauma) and then skip straight to the end of the third film (therefor ignoring the gory details)... its actually a damn good representation of how difficult it is for victims to recover and live normal lives. Every rape victim thats honest with you will tell you very cleary ""its not just about suffering through a moment of misery, being raped ruins your life PERIOD"". 

The anger and borderline insannity that Mills is going through, is actually pretty accurate to how many rape victims post-struggle in real life.<>While revenge movies are tasty, this tasteless morsel of a shit show, needs your approval in recognizing that guys are all assholes and rapists. 
This is a deplorable way to make its point, hovering over one instance for one person, and making it alright to do asshole things to others for you to get peace of mind. 
When the drunkest of drunk old barfly tells you a story of how his wife likes to be beat, this doesn't give you a by, because you were raped, to follow him home, pull his pants down, and scare him to a point of pissing himself.
That makes them no better than the rapist. 

Then, ""Hey, let's lure a guy into a dark alley, piss him off, then I'll say and do something so he will do something to me. Then, I'll make him hit me, and force himself on me. Then I'll put his bird in my mouth, and I'll bite the tip and sever it.""

This is not a revenge movie. It's tripe, and plays to a female psychopath who lures men with consensual sex, then physically and sexually assaults them, and then kills them. 

I want all my money back for watching it, and it was a free watch. 

Pure garbage<>This is a far less engaging story and far cheaper-feeling film than 1 and 2. Angela is a compelling character, but a new friend that could have injected real life into this movie ends up being misused early on, and the rest of Angela's journey is just unsatisfying. The ""twists"" at the end aren't very surprising. The movie is fine and all, it's just below the standards of the first two.<>All three of these movies were excellent. It usually gets cheesy when the slasher movies start making multiple installments, but I'd be happy to see them come out on the 4th.<>This is my worst of the 3 u never know wat is real and wat is in her mind.

A dead talking horse.<>Murphy's likeable, the script's laden with a gaggle of one-liners, and there's even a vague message nestling beneath the zoological chaos.<>Dr. Dolittle is destined to be a money maker, since kids will see the talking animals and be instantly taken in, but it is the film's utter lack of anything wholesome that causes its downfall.<>One of the things about Dr. Dolittle that helps raise it above kiddy-fare and give the accompanying adults a bit of amusing entertainment are the not-so-kid-targeted jokes.<>Provides enough entertainment for the audience to enjoy the film despite [its] flaws.<>Dr. Dolittle doesn't cut it as a family film or as a comedy farce. It's too vulgar to be the former and too inconsistent to be the latter. But consider this movie to be a test -- how many times can you laugh at one joke?<><>Eddie Murphy is one of those actors who is almost always funny. Although this is not one of his best movies, he is thoroughly enjoyable here, with the other actors mainly staying out of the way of his bits.<>Director Betty Thomas recruited a host of stand-up comedians to provide the voices for the animals, and it's a gimmick that works astonishingly well. Talking animals have never sounded so witty.<>Murphy does little more than react to stupid pet tricks.<>This movie is not fair to either man or beast.

But it's certainly better than the lacklustre sequel, which finds Eddie playing second fiddle to a performing bear.<>Takes a children's story and makes it witty and slick enough for an adult audience, while also infusing obvious lessons for the younger generation about acceptance and tolerance for those who are different.","One of the more passable Eddie Murphy Comedies Post 80's. The acting is ok overall, the supporting cast human and animal are just forgettable and generic for the most part. Eddie Murphy is actually not bad here and does a half decent job being charming and energetic. The Hamster Rodney gets annoying after awhile also. The jokes however fall flat pretty much every time especially the toilet humor ones which there is a lot of. The cinematography is ok with nothing really special set or camera-wise. The CGI on the mouths of the animals is ok enough here, I've definitely seen worse. The music isn't bad here and neither is the pacing as this moves along quickly and stays focused on Dolittle. The editing is ok, again this would've been a lot better if they had toned down the humor which really takes away lot of the charm this film has underlying it, which is quite a bit surprisingly. This could have been a much better film if they had less animals in it and had Dolittle focus on growing relationships with only a small handful rather than dozens and treated them more seriously than punchlines for flat/bad jokes. Overall if you like Murphy or animals than give this a watch, otherwise you can skip it. It's a bit of a shame this wasn't taken more seriously and had more care put into it like a Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Also next time don't have the animals animated with CGI mouths, just train them really well and have good voice actors.<>The books have a warm, calm style.

Congratulations to Jim Henson's Creature Shop for making it look like animals really can talk.

That Sugar Film should be applauded for boldly and effectively confronting the worrying rise in obesity in sugar-rich countries.<>The documentary will certainly appeal to kids with its colour, movement, clarity and humour. Adults, meanwhile, will take pause at the knowledge that the food industry has exploited our hard-wired love for sweet things to sell us unhealthy products.<>It will change the way you read food labels and detain your trolley in the produce aisle where it's safest.<>Quirky documentary about food industry engages, educates.<>Gameau ... inserts a bit of journalism into the mix with two road trips that elevate ""That Sugar Film"" beyond a semi-vanity production.<>While ""That Sugar Film"" is filled with powerful and what should be downright alarming information, it also suffers from distracting bouts of cinematic candy coating.<>Damon Gameau copies the Super Size Me model for an investigatory experiment [with] more style and pizzazz and inconsistency.<>That Sugar Film's message is one well worth hearing, there are better, more informed messengers out there.<>The food-doc shelf is crowded with good-for-you movies, including ""Fed Up,"" ""Fast Food Nation,"" ""Food Inc."" and, yes, ""Super Size Me."" ""That Sugar Film"" is a worthy addition, entertaining while informing.<>Gameau, like a certain beloved British nanny, recognizes the value in a spoonful of you-know-what helping the medicine go down.<>Peppy and eager to please, this relentless Australian documentary takes a strange approach to early death and unnatural appetites.<>Fun to watch, if a little too cutesy for my tastes.<>Although Gameau's film includes a fair amount of science, he and his helpers sweeten the film's statistics, delivering them in clever, accessible ways.<>Gameau builds his case well, and by the end of the painfully dorky musical number, you may be swapping your smoothies for berries and plain, full-fat yogurt.<>Glib but sometimes entertaining and informative recounting of everything we know about why sugar is bad for us.<>One senses that all of these kinds of documentaires are finally aggrandizing shrines made by artists trying to erect something out of nothing.<>In its substance, the film is an effective call for individuals to reduce sugar intake while exposing the places those sugars may reside.<>With its peppy, pop style, complete with silly, colorful special effects and animation, this documentary should prove accessible to school-age viewers, who might profit the most from its frank information about sugar's effect on their minds and bodies.<>[Gameau] does have an undeniable way of grabbing your attention, and it's a lack of that that seems to be half the problem when it comes to our sugar-packed diet.<>It's important to probe the Western world's overconsumption of sugar, but Gameau's attempts to do so while being hip and fun feel condescending and trite.","An eye opening documentary on the effects of processed sugar and its pervasiveness in the western - primarily American diet and the profound negative impact our American consumerism culture on the health of the world - the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Unfortunately, the host spoke in ""teaspoons"" of sugar which surprisingly was difficult even for an American to visualize just how much if this sweet ""cocaine"" is added to everything we eat. Sugar content in grams would have made much more sense.<>So good what great information this show provides!<>Whats going on?  How is it possible that hubby and wife agree again??  There's a lot of good information in 'That Sugar Film', however the approach of filmmaker Damon Gameau is preachy and at times he comes across as a bit of a narcissist.  Perhaps he has an exhibitionist fetish also which would explain his constant need to be filmed in his briefs.  In the same vein as Morgan Spurlock's 'Supersize Me' demonized the fast food industry, this documentary shines a giant light on sugar and how it could be the reason we are all fat and ugly.  Gameau takes a particular disdain at America which is totally fair, but doesn't always ring true when it's an Australian doing the bashing.  This is watchable and interesting, but the FULL frontal nudity (yes no undies) in a film that could be shown in school was too much.  There wasn't a need for shock value when you're subject is shocking from the start,  In the end, this was ok and we give it a tepid recommendation for the value that it could have on a person's health.  Hubby: 6.8/10 Wife 7.0/10 Final Average Score 6.9/10<>It wasn't your classic ""sugar is bad for you"" type of documentary. It was easy to watch, never boring and made a lot of sense but it only made me crave for more processed sugar. I really loved the song in the end. <>We all need to stop eating sugar our poor livers are dying!  This is great documentary!<>is an Australian documentary starring and directed by Damon Gameau. He goes on a 60 day high sugar diet, consuming only foods that is usually perceived as healthy. The alarming reality of the effects of sugar in our diet and how the multibillion dollar sugar industries are thriving. If this won't change the way you think about healthy foods, nothing will.<>We're surrounded by dangers, simply refused to see it.

The last time I saw such documentary film was 'Food, Inc.'. In the mean time I have seen documentaries about different topics, but not food. It was a long gap indeed, because then I was in my early twenties and now watching this film made me realise how to look at the food I eat everyday. So believe me, if you are in your late twenties and above, this will inspire you. But for others, like the youngsters and kids, it will be an educational film.

This Australian film looks funny from the outside, but the information it gives can't simply be discarded. I liked the actor, who was the writer, director, producer of the film and the dedication was highly appreciable. Because it was not just go out and make a film, but he himself placed into the centre of the film plot. Initially I thought it was a crazy idea, but at the end I'm stunned. For everything, from what he did and what this film revealed.

When it comes to the food, there are many things to be concerned. But this film was focused on sugar, about the foods we eat, which has a strong sugar presence and how it is affecting our health. Damon Gameau decided to experiment himself by consuming per day, forty teaspoons of sugar and from sugary products that easily available in the market. And monitoring carefully the changes in his body along the way his wife's pregnancy.

""Sugar's not evil, but life's so much better when you get rid of it.""

The film is not all about the experiment he's doing, it also gives some details about the people who are suffering big from modern foods. Especially I'm happy for openly giving opinions about the soft drinks from Coke and Pepsi brands. Damon also travelled to the US and he continued what he was doing, alongside collecting some new input from the experts, as well as meeting the victims. The rapid change in his physique and health gives a report on what direction the experiment is heading. From damaging the skin to the putting his internal body organs into various risks of diseases such as liver failure, heart attack and many more.

There's a brief appearance of Hugh Jackman, but don't expect more than that. It had no big impact, because the film's topic was much bigger than his part in the film. The film gave me some idea about how to deal with the food I consume. If you are concerned about your weight, particularly fat tummy, you will know what to do after watching this. I mean this does not guide you through, but opens your eyes. It points out where you are committing your mistake. It does not tell to completely cut off the sugary, but know your limit and behave.

One of the best documentary films. Do whatever you want after watching this, but before that don't think to skip it. You can call it an inspirational, educational or a message deliverer, but this film has committed to highlight what went wrong with the modern day diet. And how the food industry is responding to all the accusations. But you should know what's better for you, so think twice before touching any sugar products. Especially be aware of fructose (who is the villain of this story), which might not equate to nicotine, but the consequences are.

9/10<>Easy to digest. Super Size Me gets a sequel.<>Loved it! I've watched a lot of these sugar films.. this film I related to the most and enjoyed the most. I highly recommend watching it!<>I really enjoyed this one and the story it brought to light about so called healthy foods that we eat everyday and the effects of sugar on our bodies.

(She is French; he is Canadian.) Along with their violin-playing teenage son, David (real-life teenage composer/violinist Alexandre Sheasby), and a few friends, they perform little-known, late 19th century French-Jewish liturgical music to appreciative audiences around town. But life isn't easy for the group known as Les Cantiques (""The Canticles""). One of their singers is moving overseas, government grant money is slow in coming and they lose their rehearsal space. Though they find a more than apt replacement mezzo-soprano in the young and rebellious Abigail (Éléonore Lagacé), it's Hannah's former music professor, Samuel (Paul Kunigis), who throws things into a spin when he insists that the piece of music that he rediscovered can only be sung in the way it used to be sung more than a hundred years ago. Abigail, however, sees beauty in the piece and wants to sing it her way. The clash divides not only the group but husband and wife as well.

This is a unique premise, and the music and singing are nice to listen to but, unfortunately, together they don't add up to something that makes for gripping viewing. Artists with money problems and the conflict between those who insist on artistic purity versus those who like to interpret are subjects that are simply not exciting to watch. The film is directed by French-Israeli Raphaël Nadjari, who has seen previous success with such Israeli hits as AVANIM (""Stones"") and TEHILLIM (""Psalms""), but even those films move at a snail's pace and are not to everyone's taste.

While the performances in this film are all good - Lagacé's real-life mother, Canadian soprano Natalie Choquette sings for Pailhas - and it's interesting to listen to and learn about this obscure musical genre, it doesn't succeed in the end.

An American propaganda film made during World War 2, during the height of the conflict with Japan.  Shows Japan's history, culture, people, politics industry and military weapons and tactics, and how Japan came to be at war with the US.

Interesting.  No pretence of being a 'documentary' film this is clearly a propaganda film - the anti-Japanese sentiment is laid on quite thick at times.  Can be quite slanderous at times, and viewed in modern times and without the benefit of context, could even be viewed as racist.

Yet the context is important.  The US had a war to win and the best way to keep your soldiers and civilians motivated is to paint the enemy as evil monsters of the highest order.

Not that it's all fabricated - far from it, most of the atrocities the Japanese are accused of are true.

It's not all anti-Japanese sentiment though.  There are some interesting passages covering Japan's history and this is fairly neutral in its tone.  Therein lies the skill of the director (the great Frank Capra, no less) - mixed in with genuine history is pure propaganda, and it's sometimes difficult to tell the two apart.",Frank Capra,,,,,,,

It doesn't have any intrigue, it's your boring textbooks in highschool.<>It was a major disappointment from my end because it had such potential. The major problem is that it didn't know whether it wanted to be serious or funny. The fact that it was also like a slow-burner didn't help.

I can't say ''I like this movie very much'' as I don't like the ending that much. I thought something would happen afterward but nothing had happened.. :(

But I cannot say it's a very stunning movie, as I expected before I watched it.<>Always fascinated to see films shot in limited sets, along with a large number of actors make it exceptionally hard for any director to succeed.
ãã
In Kanikosen we saw another experiment of Sabu. Without his favorite running scenes, constant adjustments of ideas that eventually revealed his underlying message was done in a way like peeling off layers of an onion.

By shading light on (or highlighting) a particular character - guys whom aren't even the leading roles but randomly picked on set at times - to patch together clues to solve his riddle; the story is well-told. 
ãã
While I saw great attempt Sabu has made in experimenting with storytelling techniques, unfortunately he has deprived the viewers to relate to his characters (they're either killed or left out once their lines are said); a good number of viewers were even bored away before the 2nd half started... 

Sabu could've been so much better...<>Aka The Crab Cannery Ship.  Excellent dark comedy with allegorical elements of political liberation theology based in Buddhism.  This is from a 1929 novel, but the imperialist dogma espoused by the oppressors is portrayed in a theatrical style of heightened drama that works quite well.  This also aids quite a bit in the latter half, as the movement of the workers is carried out with an expressionism that smooths the transfer from the comically black to more serious drama.  

The shift is important, as the Buddhist jigoku/hell symbolism which works so well in the former half is replaced by appropriately proletarian images after the protagonists are given a revelatory visit to a Russian ship.  Ryuhei Matsuda gives a great performance as a victim of circumstance who goes from fatalistic protest to a more motivated but flawed approach.  I liked the change in this from Sabu's chase-driven plots, and the theatrically driven alternative it represents.<>Visuell kompetente und auf angenehm ungebrochene Weise agitatorische Adaption eines sozialistischen Romans aus den 1920er Jahren, der im Postwirtschaftskrisen-Japan zum Bestseller wurde.

[Full review in Spanish]<>I'm sitting here the next morning at my computer writing a review and I can't stop laughing and crying and remembering scenes.<>Tremendous credit must be given to fledging screenwriter Cody...<>A smart and very funny indie comedy that features a razor-sharp screenplay and an outstanding cast.<>As directed by Jason Reitman, the movie builds from sitcom setups to wistful payoffs.<>Whereas most people have seen charm and wit, I saw self conscious quirkiness and an excessive smugness that I found off-putting.<>One of my all time favorite films. Diablo Cody's writing is brilliant along with all the performances<>Ellen Page is so wonderful and full of heart as Juno and the emotional journey she goes on is powerful.<>A smart yet sensitive film, more a coming-of-age drama with believable American youngsters rather than TV-perfect Beverly Hills types...<>Just a lovely, lovely film which asks for nothing.<>A bouncing baby that seems destined to grow into a classic.<><><><>Sadly, while Juno may be able to carry a big bun in her oven, this film can't quite bear the heavy burden of expectation so well.<>Indie film has the same success rate as Hollywood spectacle and for the same reason--reliance on well worn stereotypes and cliché--but it's the good stuff that comes along that makes all the dreck worth sitting through. Juno is the good stuff.<>Director Jason Reitman carefully weaves the films eccentricities along with its progressive tone to create an amusing and informative - if not flawed - comedy.","It's a cute, funny comedy directed by Jason Reitman after 15 years. Once again he hits a great topical subject specifically teenage pregnancy. At the time Ellen Page was very spot-on being a young girl not ready for a baby but just wanted to make another couple happy. Michael Cera is very good too next to JK Simmons, Jason Bateman, and Jennifer Garner Diablo Cody’s screenplay allows Juno’s internal conflict to drive the story. So yes, there is a pregnancy, but this film is about growing up too fast, acceptance, and the realisation that grown ups haven’t got a clue what they’re doing either. But at its heart, Juno is a love story. The film went down in the record books. It has aged well and remains funny. The hamburger phone, gold track shorts, and protruding stripy bump are iconic and feel as fresh as they did back then. Some might not like the hipness or the soundtrack playing every 5 min but it's charming with lovable characters and snappy dialogue. <>The best acting performance from Michael Cera! With the best casting ever done in a movie! Plus, the best filmmaking debut ever from Diablo Cody! Also, the best movie screenplay ever written! And the best movie title sequence ever made!<>While somewhat exaggerated and unrealistic, ""Juno"" combines quirky, witty dialogue, humour and heart to give a look into one teenager and her unplanned pregnancy.<>Absolute dump of a film. Talks about how it's okay to get pregnant when you're 16 and completely ignores principles and what's right and wrong. The fact that bad parenting can lead to things like these is not even talked about. This film takes a massive dump on morals and principles which are absolutely absent in American society. Can't believe this have this stupid film an Oscar.<>Probably the worst dialogue in any movie I have ever tried to watch. Miserably bad.<>Juno (the former Ellen Page) is a teenager coming to grips with an unwanted pregnancy, forced to grow up faster than she ever imagined.  Jason Reitman's Juno succeeds primarily due to Diablo Cody's clever script, filled with gentle humor, interesting characters and difficult moral dilemmas.  The cast give excellent performances throughout, especially J.K. Simmons as the touchingly supportive father and Michael Cera as Juno's kind but conflicted boyfriend.  While Page is solid as the pregnant teen, her character does wear a bit thin at times, her irritating glibness often distracting from the matter at hand.  Regardless, it's a fresh and original comedy that will provoke more than its fair share of quiet laughs.<>Here is this year's indie breakout comedy. Jason Reitman's film is smart, sweet, good-hearted, wickedly funny, and shrewdly observant about teens and adults. Diablo Cody's screenplay has the snappiest dialogue of any film in many years, but treats this serious situation involving witty people of different ages in a realistic, sensible way. There are no clichés, no bad or wasted moments, and Ellen Page is brilliant in the lead, a real career-making performance. There's also pitch-perfect support from J.K. Simmons, Jennifer Garner, Allison Janney, Jason Bateman, Olivia Thirlby, and the current poster boy for gawky nerdy teen boys, Michael Cera. One of 2007's best<>Fui obrigada a assistir. Não gostei.<>Es una buena película, no sigue una ruta completamente convencional y tiene personajes interesantes. Es mejor que el promedio y realmente creo que los actores están muy bien elegidos para sus papeles. Algo que me molesta es que en muchas situaciones el protagonista abarca la situación como si fuera un paseo por el parque. Constantemente se nota que tiene angustia por el embarazo, pero a menudo hace bromas y actúa de una manera que creo que es inpropia de una persona en esa situación. Me gustan esos momentos tétricos (en mi opinión) en los que parece que Mark Loring parece un pedófilo y uno tiene miedo de lo que pueda pasar. La relación entre Juno y Paulie Bleeker me parece bastante floja, es bonita y todo, pero no hay una interacción genuinamente romántica entre los dos, solo una discusión sobre que Bleek quería ir al baile con otra -supongo que para poner celosa a Juno, aunque no lo sé- y poco más. Es una buena película y te recomiendo que la veas después de un duro día de exámenes o un largo día de trabajo. Bye<>The cast shines.

Not 1 time she mention ""foro de São Paulo"". I have to say I am amazed by the creativity of the comunist to make-up the ugly. And the truth is lula and dilma do not deserve to be know as good governments<>An excellent documentary about the rise and subsequent quashing of the lest in Brazilian politics. If you have ever wondered if there is room in our current political and economic systems for the fairer distribution of resources, this documentary gives you an answer. Yes. It is specific to Brazil but there are lessons for the whole world over.

Lula Inacio Da Silva, part of the far left workers movement, rose to the highest office in Brazil. No doubt a very well intentioned man, he set about redistributing wealth and improving the living standards of the poorest in society.  It is striking to see how as president the structures he must operate in and the relationships he begins to develop restrict his ability to represent his working class followers. That said the lowest in society do see increases in there standard of living as he holds true to his beliefs.

He also launches a crack down on corruption. These good intentions will be his undoing as the investigations he starts are turned on him. The investigators are people embedded in the legal system who are incentivised to maintain the status quo. Along with big business, the media and right wing politicians they launch a campaign to unseat Lula and his successor Dilma Rousseff.

They are investigated on campaign finance rules. Even though they are pro workers, they need finance to stay in power. Does this compromise their ideals? Probably. But what is the alternative. Ban campaign financing?

Right wing politicians impeach Dilma over budgeting irregularities which seem to be a matter of accounting treatment and not misappropriation. The media launches the case against Lula and whips his right wing detractors into a frenzy. The state solicitor takes a case against Lula and then also convicts him (cause no judge is needed in Brazil) and Lula goes to jail.

This all paves the way for Jair Bolsonaro. The establishment hold their noses (much like the US for Trump) and throw their support behind him and he is now president. Although there might be time for a happy ending as since the documentary, Lula has had his conviction quashed and can now run in the next election.

This story is told very well in this documentary. The producers have lots of great footage including taped conversations and it is all laid bare. From personal takes highlighting the political divides in society and also families.<>Filme de propaganda política, pautada em inverdades.<>The sad true story about politics in Brazil.<>How did we get to Bolsonaro? In 2020, this is a question on the minds of many political commentators. Edge of Democracy ""Democracia em Vertigem"" provides a convincing answer to this relevant question. 
     Why did Jair Bolsonaro defeat former São Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad and become president of Brazil in 2018? Bolsonaro is a strongman. He has been dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics."" He is an authoritarian leader who espouses populist, homophobic, and sexist rhetoric. How is it that Brazil, the fifth largest country in the world, elected someone so reactionary and appalling? The easiest answer: Bolsonaro was an imperfect antidote to the endemic corruption that has been so prevalent in Brazil for the past decades. 
     Not long ago, Dilma Rouseff— the first woman to be elected as president in Brazil— was impeached for corruption. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, another Workers' Party politician, was also arrested. Still other Workers' Party politicians have been mired by one of the biggest political scandals of the 21st Century— Operation Lava Jato (Car Wash). It seems that Brazilians sought out an alternative to this corruption. This is the perfect documentary for outside observers to understand how Brazil got to this point.<>Hallucinated fiction<>It's an outstanding movie!!<>Não há nenhuma expectativa sobre o filme, não consigo nem descrever o filme.

                   -Hank Hill<>Great movie. In Soderbergh's third film ever, he shows a strong grasp on both direction and storytelling, delivering a captivating and powerful drama with well-written characters and dialogue, as well as a phenomenal lead performance from a young Bradford.<>A true masterpiece - outstanding, an absolute favorite that seems to have all but disappeared for those of us who'd love to see it again! Well crafted with its gut-wrenching and uplifting moments with a remarkable ensemble of fascinating, very real characters, many of whom seem worthy of their own movie around their own situation.  Desperate circumstances put young Aaron in a survival mode in the bleak depression yet this film is anything but depressing.  Often harsh and intense, yet full of entertaining moments and Aaron's unsinkable spirit carrying him through it all.<>Really good ... I like it<>The story of Aaron, the coolest kid on the block, and his struggling family during the depression in the 1930's.

Aron is doing well in school, even with few money. His parents are not earning much and are often not around trying to get money from places further away. He tries to get hold of some money himself with varied results. Still, his biggest feature is that he is super kind and everyone likes him. He is the coolest and best kid on the block.

Both Bradford and Brody are rock solid and is lofting the superb story. It looks good and got few flat moments - some uplifting ones, some sadder ones, but no flat moments. This is feel good to the fullest. Soderbergh shows a lot of heart here, in one of his earlier and slightly overlooked film.

Oh, also way cool to see Lauren Hill as an elevator girl.

7.5 out of 10 cigar bands.<>One of my all time favorites !<>A good depression era coming-of-age story from early in Soderbergh's career. I was impressed with Jesse Bradford's performance and the style of the film. Great production design.<>Jamais acanhado de agradar a um grande público, Steven Soderbergh tem em ""King of the Hill"" o seu filme mais capaz de encaixar numa reconfortante matiné de domingo para toda a família.

When it comes to coming of age films, they are generally a hit and miss for me as I don't particularly have a particular type of film within the genre; all I look for is an entertaining story for me to invest in. The coming of age genre, over time has developed its own clichÃ©s that many films can't seem to shake out of, which is why when I come into a film from the genre, I ensure to lower my expectations and hopefully the film would deliver enough original aspects that it wouldn't end up being a waste of time.

The film's plot is certainly light in its tone but heavy in its themes. Steven Soderbergh, the film's screenwriter and director, has delivered a tale of a young boy who lives in a cruel world and has to do what he can in order to survive. I was on board with his journey right from the start as the film establishes the connection with the character right from the start, using the film's small but abundant complications to threat our protagonist at a deep level. There are a number of scenes in this film that feels heartbreaking to watch, the graduation would be a prime example, and the fact that Soderbergh was able to deliver more than just one, shows me how gifted of a writer he is. The film's final act may come off at first as sentimental and forced, but with everything that the audience and the protagonist has gone through, one can't help but look for something warm to hold onto.

There were elements in this film that reminded me of Wes Anderson's Rushmore, as Aaron, our protagonist, has this need to create a false persona to avoid social hardships and to be standing and recognised on the same level as his wealthy classmates. Unlike Max Fischer in Rushmore, Aaron's rationales for his facade carry a much heavier weight, which made it easier for me to empathise for his decisions and sympathise for his feelings.

The film could have simply been a conventionally told story and dampened by its sentimentality, but Soderbergh handles it with such balance and precision that the film contains only the right amount of both conventionality and sentimentality. I was truly impressed with the director's choice to go slightly pessimistic in both its emotions and atmosphere during the early stages of the third act, as it made our protagonist feel like a human being rather than just hollow plot driver, also this change of tone showed me that Soderbergh is willing to take risks and show suffering in a pragmatic way.

I am going to make an assumption and state that this film was built by a limited budget, which made it difficult to create a richly detailed environment of the Depression era. Soderbergh was able to counter this through focusing its film on the protagonist and limiting his movement from different locations, but the aspect that truly drawn me into the film's world is its warm-palette photography. The photography not only immersed me physically, but it also hit me at an emotional and empathetic level, where I too can feel the heat that is surrounding Aaron, getting closer and hotter as the film progresses.

The performance brought by Jesse Bradford certainly deserves high recognition, as he was able to display both the innocence and vulnerability of a child while also showing that he is strong-willed boy who would go through great lengths for survival. The film's supporting cast was also strong with memorable performances by Adrien Brody, Spalding Gray, Lisa Eichhorn, and Jeroen Krabbe.

King of the Hill is a special coming of age films that isn't afraid to go towards the darker side of the spectrum to deliver realistic conditions of the 1930s, while also retaining that child-like sensibility that allows the film to be universally accessible. So far this is the most impressive feat I have seen from film-retired director, Steven Soderbergh.<>Review In A Nutshell:

King of the Hill is a special coming of age films that isn't afraid to go towards the darker side of the spectrum to deliver realistic conditions of the 1930s, while also retaining that child-like sensibility that allows the film to be universally accessible. So far this is the most impressive feat I have seen from film-retired director, Steven Soderbergh.","Albert Berger, Barbara Maltby, Ron Yerxa",,$879.6K,,PG-13,,"Surround, Stereo",

But the two main characters are just so endearing that their chemistry fills the gaps nicely.","Marked by a dry sense of humour, this lighthearted Icelandic comedy is about two very different colleagues who unexpectedly over a weekend at work find condolences in each other for their failed romances and undergo a switch in their relationship status.<>Two fellas are working together in the middle of nowhere on Iceland. They set poles to ground next to the roads and paints yellow stripes in the middle of them, five meters apart.
Alfred and Finnbogi know eachother. Finnbogi is married to Alfreds sister. She is in Vienna while they are working. Alfred is only 24 and likes to party and get laid in the weekends.
They share a lot, they fight a bit. There are ups, there are downs. Few other people are involved, only a truckdriver really, that regularly shares some quality moonshine with the workers before he get's back on the road.

I like this film for it's simplicity and it looks. The stories and the acting. Atypical like most Icelandic flicks and a short little treat.

When Don Revie quits Leeds to become the England boss, the outspoken Brian Clough takes charge. Determined to impose his own style upon Revie's tough tackling team, Clough soon alienates his players and the board.

It was not due to Sheen's acting, but rather to a boring and confusing script.<>The Damned United eliminates the existential anguish and pain that propelled Peace's novel, and curtails its lowering style.<>as foreign for American audiences as a story about one of Billy Martin's stints with the Yankees would be in the U.K.<>If soccer is a Shakespearean drama, then The Damned United is Richard III.<>Michael Sheen has played vampires and werewolves, but works up his most insatiable bloodlust as Brian Clough in this sharply observed, superbly acted drama that realizes sports forms as nasty a symbiotic relationship with a nation's people as politics.<>Morgan, Hooper and Sheen have crafted a moving, funny and loving tribute to the spirit of a man who effortlessly defined the spirit of the greatest sport ever.<>A provocative, darkly funny and particularly damning character study of hubris couched in idealism.<>This slice of British football sports history won't have any cultural resonance for us Yanks... but the portrait of ambition and hubris run amok resonates in any arena...<>""The Damned United"" is a fascinating look at a very complex man, both talented and tone-deaf, arrogant and insecure, caring and hard-hearted.<>Finds its riveting story in the locker-room and board-room wranglings of competitive team leaders, and dissects them with documentary-style precision.<>Refusing to devolve into a routine sports flick (see Invictus), The Damned United is instead more interested in the off-field clashes than the on-field skirmishes.","This is a reasonably good film at depicting the passion people have for a local football team. Good performances from a good cast, particularly Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall. Its mainly about the level of influence that the manager has over the direction the football team take and how much attention others pay to him. I imagine football fans would enjoy this, so I'd recommend it, yes.<>one of the best sports movie out there.<>The movie is on Sheen and that's all it needs.<>The name Brian Clough will be familiar to those who love football, and even to those who know nothing about the sport. The eccentric English manager remains an enormous part of English footballing history, winning a number of major honours and changing the way football was played in this country. Tom Hooper's excellent biopic focuses on Clough's infamous and ill-fated 44 day stint as Leeds United manager, after their beloved Don Revie had left to become England manager. Previous jabs and insults from Clough towards the way Leeds played left plenty of ill feeling towards him that was still very much bubbling when he joined them, and only got worse when he stood by his comments and tried to completely change the ethos of the clubs approach to playing. Michael Sheen is, as you'd expect, ludicrously good in capturing the essence of Clough, and he is excellently supported by the likes of Colm Meaney, Jim Broadbent, and Timothy Spall.<>A good story line, plus Michael Sheen does a brilliant job of playing Brian Clough. Clough himself had a unique mannerism and I don't think many other actors could've portrayed him so well.

Having said that, I'm not giving it 4*-5* stars because the film is riddled with historical inaccuracies, for example portraying that Leeds lost 1-0 to Luton Town when it was instead a 1-1 draw, or insinuating that Clough left Brighton having never managed the team whereas in reality he managed them for a year. The fact that some people portrayed in this film such as Dave Mackay and Johnny Giles have sued the production company is an instant red flag in relation to it's accuracy.

It's a good watch if you are a football fan, but beware that it's not completely accurate.<>Ah, Tom Hooper... Depending on who you ask, The King's Speech, The Danish Girl, and Les Miserables have all gone down with many as some combination of the most overrated films in awards season over the past two decades, all helmed by that director. I have not recently seen any of the three in their entirety, but Hooper's reputation preceded him. This is without even mentioning Cats. 

As a football supporter not alive during Clough's heyday, I was intrigued to see such a well-reviewed exploration of Clough's lowest point in 1974, especially juxtaposed with his past successes. Ask what Clough is known for today, and most football fans will respond with the events after this and Clough's success with Nottingham Forest, which the film does not cover. To this end, I give TDU credit for not falling into the classic sports film trap of the hero's journey to an outpouring of success in the film's climax. However, the marvelously nuanced performances of Sheen, and Spall to a lesser degree, never seem replicated by the film's treatment of events documented by the film in Clough's background. Colm Meaney as Revie is blatantly antagonistic, as is Jim Broadbent as Sam Longson, as are the Leeds United players, and so forth. The story gives no care to the notion that Clough must have been well-regarded or full of potential in some circles of Leeds, at least initially, for his move to Leeds to go ahead. Although TDU offers Sheen great material in his internal struggle and occasional delusions, every relationship except that with Spall as his assistant, Taylor, never exceeds the disappointingly hollow. Therefore, due to either Hooper's direction or the screenplay of Peter Morgan (The Crown, Rush, The Queen, Frost/Nixon), The Damned United fails beyond a superb Michael Sheen performance.<>Being an avid leeds fan I quite enjoy the movie but counted 16 mistakes including a score in the film which said we lost to Luton when in fact it was a 1-1 draw!
I once spoke to sniffer Alan Clarke about it as I was there and he confirmed he scored in the game!
Alan also said he watched the film and closed his eyes and he thought it was clough
So great performance by Michael sheen<>An interesting character study that will be of interest to even those who aren't football fans. It does well at capturing the atmosphere and mysticism around football at that time.<>A solid retelling of the Clough Revie feud.

Excellent movie. Ingrid Bergman and Helen Hayes are perfect in their roles. Yul Brynner also does an excellent job.

Still fascinating speculation/drama with compelling Bergman and Brynner in title roles.<>To be or not to be, this is the problem...<>Despite the Oscar winning performance from Ingrid Bergman which also reunited her with her Hollywood throne, Anastasia doesn't offer much more in the way of depth and doesn't succeed to engage throughout the 105 minutes in which the film runs. It's a nervy fairytale but the show very much feels finished earlier on until a marvellous turn from Helen Hayes as the empress. Hayes is delightful and her scenes with Bergman offer much redemption to the film's less positive qualities. Overall, the film suffers from mediocre pacing among other things but still manages to impress with a superb score and stellar performances.<>Is she the long lost princess? A return to those glorious days of a benevolent monarchy? Or only a deluded wannabe? Bergman walks this tightrope with particular aplomb, and that part of the story swirls a mist of mystery that is sweet indeed. But the other half of the story sinks because there is no magnetic energy between Brynner and she. Zip. Nada. Eh. They should remake this.

This is the type of movie you'll watch and wonder why you've never heard more about it.<>Shows how misfits can be necessary spiritual teachers for youth coming-of-age.<><><><><><><><>","John Tuturro was such an upcoming and well-established newcomer to Hollywood he was practically in everything and this is no exception
In 1960's Los Angeles he plays father Sid and husband of the Lidz family; he's very into documenting everything that happens to preserve the memories teaching his son everything about the stars, social issues etc.
starring next to Andie Macdowell and Michael Richards of 'Seinfeld' fame comes a story about a boy Steven making an unusual bond with his uncles during a difficult pastime 
his mother Selma has fallen ill and he's worried she's gonna die so he decides to stay with his other relatives until she recovers
He stays with Uncle Arthur and Uncle Danny; Danny although is more of the paranoid one thinking everyone's out to get him and gather intel so he may not be the best example to follow
Steven does what he thinks is right for him and his mother but at the same time he's learning to become a man
people get trapped in their own history until someone shows them the way out, we grow in the most unexpected ways, it's not right to throw memories away
the actors pour their hearts into these roles, even the kid playing Steven is really incredible here just needing an outlet for hope and optimism, the score is very touching as well 
ending is tragic but it does help bring this unusual family even more closer 
Director Diane Keaton handles the human grief element very well showing how family relationships can grow even more letting the healing process begin<>Diane Keaton film was amazing filled with heartfelt characters that will never forget.it's a shame that Hollywood stop making movies as beautiful and artistic as this one. Michael Richards definitely steals the show though.<>Unstrung Heroes is an excellent film. It is about Steven Lidz, unhappy with his home life since his mother got sick, goes and lives with his two crazy Uncles. Andie McDowell, Nathan Watt and John Turturro give incredible performances. The screenplay is well written. Diane Keaton did a great job directing this movie and it is her directorial debut. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the humor and drama.<>Wonderfully sad and funny film by the renowned Diane Keaton about familial love, memories and grief, with two wildly eccentric uncles thrown in. Heartwarming and touching--a great watch.<>I watch this movie long time ago, just came across this DVD, very nice.<>Keaton's directorial debut is not bad but not great. I think she suffers from the same problem as Tom Hanks..the need to show something to be loved rather than something edgy. The result is passable stuff but not memorable stuff.<>There was something simple about this movie that bothered me, perhaps it was the ""unstrung"" people that this family was surrounded with? Perhaps it was the way the parents raised their children in an unusual way where for that time period it seemed odd that they did not discipline their children and seemed to give them huge freedoms? I think that was what really got me, but despite this I still enjoyed watching the eccentricities of the uncles and their impact on Franz and how he accepted them as a way for him to cope with loss.<>I didn't like this movie at first. It made me uncomfortable, in part because I expected something more along the lines of two of my favorite nineties films, ""Wide Awake"" and ""Little Man Tate."" Steven/Franz's father was a total jerk, to me, and the mental illness of the uncles didn't seem like it was actually going to be TREATED like illness. I felt very uncomfortable for Franz Lidz, feeling sorry that he had grown up in such an environment. The first half of this movie fooled me, however. Not everything in it was what it seemed. As it got closer and closer to the end, a rich mix of emotion bubbled up through the surface without becoming sticky, sickly, or melodramatic, and the conclusion made me tear up. I began to care about these characters like they were a quirky extension of my own family. The main idea I took from the whole thing is that Franz was a smart kid who could handle the less-than-pleasant side of the world, and seeing as how he wrote the memoir that inspired this nice little movie, it sure seems like he did. It's a shame that this movie is doomed to relative obscurity. It's definitely the kind of quirky-yet-grounded movie that doesn't get made anymore... at least, not this way.<>Very sad but entertaining.

Excelente obra dos irmãos Taviani em mais uma excelente sessão do cineclube Xícara da Silva!<>This is so cool -- high security prison puts on Julius Caesar, and the actors are recognizing themselves in some of the scenes.<>'Caesar Must Die' is a drama which unfolds within the physical confines of an actual Italian prison. Neither a full documentary nor a movie, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar is reinterpreted by the real inmates of Rome's Rebibbia prison, who stage the historical episode of Caesar's assassination and its aftermath. By bringing into the story their personal existential wounds and future expectations, this docufiction explores in depth the inmates' internal conflicts and their yearning for some ultimate salvation. In one of the final lines of this transcendentally powerful drama-within-a-drama, one of the inmates opens up even further honestly telling us that ""now that I have found art, this cell of mine looks like a prison."" Moving and inspiring at the same time.<>Like a box within a box, within a box. Prisoners with pretty serious sentences are doing a Shakespare play, that they will present as a theatric piece. They rehearse, they act, they plan - they really want to do this.

The interesting thing here are the real prisoners, with real emotions and real passion for this thing.
The Taviani brothers stated that they hoped that the viewers saw the prisoners for the humans they are. This semi-documentary, done in a high-security prison in Rome is well shot, lovely produced and got a great pace. It's not a second too short - this means it tends to be boring - hey, this is mostly inmates preparing for a theatrical show. In the end it was still deeply satisfying for me. Original, thought-provoking film with lovely photography. Touching, interesting and a nice film about theatre, freedom and prison.

7.5 out of 10 tyrannies.<>Mesclando a ficção com o documentário (o que o aproxima do grande ""Jogo de Cena"", de Eduardo Coutinho), ""César Deve Morrer"" é uma brilhante e evocativa celebração ao poder redentor e transcendental da Arte, a qual, a despeito das segregações sócio-acadêmicas, revela-se muito mais próxima de nossas vidas do que antes imaginávamos. 
Nesse caso, a obra de Shakespeare consegue ressoar de forma tão profunda na trajetória pessoal de cada um dos presidiários protagonistas, que estes, ao incorporarem os dramas e personagens de ""Júlio César"", encontram na peça uma via única de expressão, redenção e liberdade para suas almas marcadas pelo cativeiro (externo e interno). Desse modo, conferimos um interessante exemplo do poder transformador que a Arte exerce não só sobre diferentes histórias e realidades, mas também sobre ela mesma, haja vista as novas nuances e leituras que a própria peça de Shakespeare ganha ao longo dessa experiência no presídio - e tal dicotomia entre a independência espaço-temporal e a necessária relação da Arte com seus receptores físicos não deixa de ser outro fascinante objeto de observação.
Filmado em um evocativo preto e branco que culmina nas cores do clímax da apresentação final, ""César Deve Morrer"" nos presenteia com belíssimas e inspiradas passagens, sustentadas pelo uso inventivo do espaço presidiário e pela força das atuações do elenco principal (com destaque para Salvatore Striano, com seu atormentado Brutus). E se os momentos ""verídicos"" da projeção soam artificiais ou fracos, isso só demonstra o enorme (e mais expressivo) espaço que a Arte acabou ocupando na vida dessas pessoas - e, porque não, na vida dos expectadores.<>""It's an arresting, playful and moving film ...""<>The Shakespeare's Julius Caesar represented by the inmates in a prison.

As Camille relates her tales of crime and passion to Stanislas, she slowly mesmerizes the impressionable young scholar. Falling under her spell, the smitten Stanislas risks meeting the same fate as her earlier beaux.","Bernadette Lafont, André Dussollier, Charles Denner, Philippe Léotard, Guy Marchand, Gilberte Geniat, Claude Brasseur, Michel Delahaye, François Truffaut, Jean-Loup Dabadie, Henry Farrell, François Truffaut, Marcel Berbert, Georges Delerue, Pierre-William Glenn, Yann Dedet","In the comic context of A Gorgeous Bird Like Me, a good deal of the savour is lost simply because this femme comes over as much less fatale than may have been intended.<>Lafont's antic embodiment of feminine ferocity cuts cleverly against Truffaut's grim vision of a world that both represses and craves it, and the comedy masks the endless round of victimhood.","Truffaut's dark humor is on display here; the show is all Lafont's, but the film wears a bit thin after a while.<>Review In A Nutshell:

As directors, it is important for one to completely understand the character that is being explored, they need to show understanding and only from that understanding does one have the right to lay personal judgement on the subject. A Gorgeous Girl Like Me follows a sociologist, who is conducting an interview with a female prisoner, Camille Bliss, for a thesis he has on criminal women.

His role is quite similar to a director's, he observes them and asks questions that hopefully would reveal profound answers that would stir the minds of those who are reading/listening. It was this connection that allowed a personal touch to be found in the protagonist, Stanislas Previne; seeing Truffaut in the personality and mindset of its character. Though he is the conductor of the interview and would play a large role in the way the story would be told once his project is finished, it was the subject that remained fascinating, drawing me in from the start with her sharp but seductive personality.

It is from the moment she opened her mouth and exposed her history to the professor that I became lost into the tale; constantly in a state of intrigue by her long and wild story, balancing both adventure and personal drama. I was hooked by the amount of relationships she has had, and many of them were men, and how she used those relationships in order to live day to day. There was enough insight about the multiple factors that could have contributed to her adult personality, and furthermore was gained from the opinionated contributions from Stanislas. It was the idea that men cannot seem to detach themselves away from her, constantly in a state of lust and curiosity when they see her face, and cannot completely explain why this is so. As an audience, especially for the males, we are able to share similar feelings and thoughts, but not completely have a grasp on why we have them.

As the film progresses, a subtle seed that was laid on Stanislas, and also the audience, has begun to grow, manipulating us in wanting to save her from her awful and difficult position; even if somewhere in the back of our minds that we have doubts about her pure intentions. The film ends in a perfect note, leaving us saddened for the events that had unfold, and could only hope that somehow justice would be served.

A Gorgeous Girl Like Me is a striking narrative achievement by Francois Truffaut, being able to tell a dark and twisted story, while maintaining a sense of lightness and humour in between. It is a tale that I am willing to return to, even if it is just to see Camille Bliss' face again; it may be bad for my wellbeing but I simply do not care.<>The femme fatale here is mind-boggling. Why can she always succeed?<>È il secondo film di Truffaut che vede (il primo è ""effetto notte"") e per ora non ne vedo per nulla la genialità. Aspetterò ancora prima di dare un giudizio definitivo.<>FranÃ§ois Truffaut's films never cease to amaze. Most have a gritty sense of reality softened with black humor and light touches, and the rest are kick-ass lessons in drama or period filmmaking. ""Les 400 coups"" was a Cannes winner, ""La niut americaine"" an Oscar winner, ""La mariÃ (C)e Ã (C)tait en noir"" was a box office hit and an inspiration for the likes of Brian dePalma or Tarantino, the Doinel quintology is in another level entirely, etc, etc. Off course that some of his ""lighter"" films are forgotten, seldom seen or discussed. I have seen about 20 of his 25 films, and ""Une belle fille comme moi"" was one of those less known and less talked about I had never seen. Yet, once again, I was blown away. One can see why this is not hailed as a ""masterpiece"", the simple storyline and the simple way it is delivered denies those major perfect scenes by which movies are remembered. Yet it cannot be denied that ""Une belle fille comme moi"" is an amazing black comedy, brilliant all the way, and one which attacks, quite beautifully, hidden among its lighter structure, the judicial system, and mostly the psychologists' justifications for behavior. In ""Les 400 coups"" we had little inklings of Truffauts perspective on what the ""system"" devised as excuses for the behavior of juvenile delinquents, but here the attack is full frontal. Made in 1972 between the period drama ""Les deux Anglaises et le continent"" (1971) and his most successful american film ""La nuit americaine"" (1973), ""Une belle fille comme moi"" narrates the story of voluptuous Camille Bliss (Bernadette Lafont). She is in prison for murder and receives the visits of a sociologist (AndrÃ (C) Dussollier), who is trying to write a book on woman criminals. She tells him in flashback her adventures, in which she basically beds every man in sight in order to climb the social ladder and pursue her dream of being a singer. Off course that what her voice over says to the sociologist is not exactly what we see happen on screen... The body pile builds up, due to ""accidents"", and she juggles 4 lovers until the events lead up to her capture. Yet, as the interviews progress, the sociologists seems about to become another victim of Camille's charms, and events can take a major twist! With an incredibly simple plot, Truffaut fires his shots directly at the judicial system, at the same time as he, very humorously, adds elements of noir films, as the femme fatale jumps from one lover to another, turning ones against the others, so that she can come out on top. After a few years in prison, she has also the talent still to juggle with the sociologist, which can be her ticket to freedom. It may not be very believable, but many movies have been made with similar plots but with way less quality. Truffaut proves once again his marvelous comic timing, and how he can make a social commentary without forcing a dramatic view on the audience. This will please for the movie itself, and not for its underlying message. For that, this is a great film, and I don't understand why this is not among Truffaut's masterpieces. Enjoyed it very, very much (more so than other supposed Truffaut's masterpieces).<>Truffaut's homage to womanhood, free spirited souls and quirky romantic human flaws from the perspective of his beautiful heroine Bernadette Lafont. Seen at the New York French Alliance in 2009.<>A bawdy comedy from Truffaut. Some of it is dumb, some smart, none of it great. But it's charming and entertaining enough to be worthwhile. Bernadette Lafont plays one of those unstoppable Truffaut heroines like Jeanne Moreau in Jules et Jim or The Bride Wore Black. The movie skips from one amusing anecdote to another as Camille expertly manipulates the multitude of men in her life. While it's not the best (or even the funniest) movie in Truffaut's body of work, it's a good bit of fun.<>Truffaut once again showed the mercy, from the bottom of his heart, to those beautiful & intelligent women regardless their devices in this funny noir piece.<>Quite enjoyable and light-hearted quirky black comedy. This film is without doubt an example of Truffaut's great sense of intuition in casting main actresses in his films. It's like he possessed a sixth sense in this respect. The actress that made also her debut in Truffaut's memorable short-film debut, ""Les Mistons"", the unequivocal beauty, Bernadette Lafont, seems ideal for this leading part and in reality makes this film click.<>So funny, I was laughing out loud!

'Tightrope' should have all the ingredients to make the viewer be on the edge of their seat, and yet I really didn't care much for it. Clint Eastwood, who apparently took over unofficially as director from Richard Tuggle during filming, gives a solid performance and the bond with his character's children is cute.

However, the story just didn't do anything for me. It's not particularly unnerving, despite a dark on paper story, and it's rather predictable - the villain... well, the villain I've already forgotten about and I only finished watching about an hour ago.

Not terrible, but not good.<>Between 2.5 and 3 stars. It has the good ingredients for a good thriller, but it is not very subtle and sometimes focuses too much in sex and too little in the mistery.<>_Tightrope_ is a tawdry sex thriller taking place in New Orleans, where detective Block (Clint Eastwood) is tracking a serial rapist / murderer whose victims are the same S & M prostitutes that Block himself routinely gets involved with---as a customer.
But Block is no ""bad lieutenant."" He's a divorced dad who dotes on his two young daughters. He has several dogs, and he's just generally a good guy. So his sexual deviance is an anomaly, and it's not explained. Did it cause his wife to leave him? Of is it his response to that divorce? The latter is implied but not elaborated on.
The film is mostly shot at night, so a lot of the scenes are dark and hard on the eyes.  We are exposed to the underbelly of the Crescent City----the brothels and S & M clubs. There's a lot of jazz on the soundtrack (provided by Lennie Niehaus, who did the music for Eastwood's Charlie Parker biopic _Bird_. 
The police procedural aspect of the story moves slowly. The most interesting thing  is Block's relationship with a woman who runs a rape crisis center, played by Genevieve Bujold. 
Eastwood has become such a respected icon as a director and an actor that it's strange to see him in such a sleazy movie, even sleazier than the Dirty Harry films of the 1970s. But _Tightrope_ was made was the 80's, when sleaze escalated to the max in Hollywood. DePalma and Lynch were hitting it big, and Alan Parker's despicable _Angel Heart_ was a huge success. Cultural rebellion against the Reagan era? Possibly. In one scene in a warehouse full of Mardi Gras paraphernalia, the camera briefly pans across a Reagan mask.
The film makes good use of its setting, with lots of scenes on Bourbon Street and the French Quarter, and the climactic scene takes place in one of the city's famous above ground cemeteries.
It's suspenseful, for sure, but you'll cringe a lot. I like Eastwood a lot better in his later films. As he got older, he got more thoughtful and decent.
By the way, if you've been to New Orleans, this film might make you nostalgic for Dixie Beer.<>Tightrope is a heavy handed, substandard Clint Eastwood film.  Poor supporting cast.  Poor musical score.  Poor cinematography.  Most of the scenes were shot at night, so the audience must spend most of their time in front of a mostly dark screen.  Clint Eastwood plays a detective in New Orleans on the case of a seral killer who's haunt is the local sex scene.  Coincidentally, it is also where Clint's character likes to hang out. He is no Dirty Harry here, but rather more like the Jazz DJ in 'Play Misty for Me' with a badge.  The female lead is a Canadian actress who sounds Hispanic, looks French, and acts like Pia Zadora.

Clint stars as a hard-nosed detective (does he play any other kind?) trying to figure out who's behind a string of murders in New Orleans. But these aren't just any murders, as the female victims were all part of the wonderful world of kinky sex. Our hero's mean squint gets even squintier when it becomes obvious the women are being targeted because of their kinky relations with him. It's reasonably paced, not entirely predictable and nicely buffered with some cute (sometimes hilarious) father-daughter moments (Clint's real-life offspring, Alison, plays one of his two girls). Decent watch.","Clint Eastwood, Fritz Manes",,,,R,,,

With exteriors of `60s London, fog-shrouded streets, and high-contrast B&W angular studio interiors.  

Karl Lob's cinematography, (he also did Lang's 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse) emphasizes every scene of social impropriety or discomfort - either for comic or shock effect.  Even fabricating P.O.V. shots - from behind the teeth at a vegetarian's incoming bread stick, or from below a transparent sink basin for compulsive hand-washing action.  Der Zinker's spring-loaded black mamba venom gun is used well, with a mid-plot sequence showing the unknown villain manufacturing it's crystallized projectile.

Klaus Kinski is terrific as the creepy animal keeper named Krischna, fetishistically playing with a python, and crawling out of the animal's cage on all fours.  From the opening shot, you know that regardless of Der Zinker's identity, Krischna is definitely not right.  

Peter Thomas' swinging score is very enjoyable, and complements his SF & Spy film soundtracks, even his re-scoring of Fists of Fury/The Big Boss.  There is a great sense of playful fun about all of the murderous goings-on, and the finale carries that out well.","Preben Philipsen, Horst Wendlandt",,,,,,,

I disliked the main character so much I couild not find any empathy so was mostly annoyed....one person in the audience laughed at the absurdity but I could not find humor in the extremes.<>Citizen Kane - The Queer Rearview: Hester Street ★★★★

I've always had a soft spot for immigration stories, especially considering both sets of my grandparents came to America from Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century. By escaping the oppression they faced as Jews, my grandparents traveled to a new world rife with problems of its own. They struggled to fit in and were drawn to communities of other Jewish immigrants. 

As such, the film Hester Street, the late great Joan Micklin Silver's 1975 feature film debut, resonates so much for me. Telling the tale of Gitl (Carol Kane in her Oscar nominated performance), an Orthodox Jewish woman who in 1896 arrives in Manhattan from Russia with her young son to reunite with her assimilated husband Yankel (Steven Keats), now known as Jake, the film could not be more relevant now, with immigration issues at the forefront of our modern world. 

The Cohen Film Collection has released a 4K restoration of this classic where it hopefully will inspire a new generation of fans. Silver, who sadly passed away last year, has rarely been mentioned in the same conversation as the male directors of her era, yet deserves the praise for this film, along with Crossing Delancey, Chilly Scenes of Winter, and more. At a time when very few women had the chance to direct feature films, she proved herself a maverick with her own distinctive voice. 

Filmed in black and white with an appropriate simplicity often seen in silent films or Yiddish theater, Hester Street first introduces us to Jake, who works in a sweatshop and carries on an affair with a dancer who possesses the relax bluster of a modern American woman. Jake seems happy to have shed his European influences and has his bubble burst when news comes to him of his wife's impending arrival. He arranges with his neighbor Mrs. Kavarsky (a young Doris Roberts) for some furniture and a roommate, Mr. Bernstein (Mel Howard), to help provide a place for his family.

His first glimpse of Getl and his son tells us everything we need to know. Clearly devout, Gitl wears a traditional wig and speaks Yiddish. Jake seems embarrassed by them, so Americanized is he that he looks at them with a disdain that has seemingly always been a part of the U.S. experience. Afraid and obedient, Gitl clings to her traditions while trying to make a nice home for her husband and son. Kane's performance, almost silent for most of the running time, remains a work of pure beauty. We can see everything in her eyes as she navigates a difficult, abusive situation and finds her strong, confident voice. A gifted comic actor ever since, this film serves as a reminder of Kane's great dramatic talent as well. 

Hester Street gets able support from its Cinematographer, Kenneth Van Sickle, and Production Designer Stuart Wurtzel, who give us the rich atmosphere of Lower East Side Manhattan, from its market stalls to the dingy, barren walls of the tenements. It may feel less grand than the visuals from The Godfather: Part II, but it has a similar nostalgic impact. 

Silver packs a lot into her adaptation of Abraham Cahan's novella, ""Yekl"", exploring the issues of xenophobia, sexism, spousal abuse, assimilation, and how to assert yourself in a scary new world. All of this gets covered in a deceptively slight, unassuming package. 

If I had one quibble, it's that the restoration is a bit too perfect. The style of this film calls for a little wear and tear, a little grain in its images. The clarity here detracts a bit from the immersive feeling of the original release. Don't let that stop you, however, from seeking out this gem and honoring the special talents of Carol Kane and Joan Micklin Silver.<>A great film, with magnificent performances by Carol Kane as Gitl and Doris Roberts as Mrs. Kavarsky. The rest of the cast is also excellent, as is the nuanced direction by Joan Micklin Silver.  And the depiction of early 20th century life on the lower East Side is unforgettable.<>Shot in all black and white this is an immigration story about what it is to find love in America.
It's 1896 and an immigrant family in NYC are trying to get used to assimilation. Jake is the head of the family 
A woman named Gitl has arrived with her son seeking her husband. When she and Jake rum into one another things change entirely. 
She and her son are introduced to the customs and cultural norms of this country but of course it'll take time to fully integrate. 
Jake is caught in a bind though knowing too many women and even his wife. 
This movie is very short but Carol Kane and Steven Keats work quite well despite not having too much screentime together. 
For a pilgrim coming to America there's a lot to be had<>its actors are good but the script is not.<>Solid film!  An interesting snapshot of Jewish immigrant life in late 1800s New York.  All the acting is top notch; the plot moves along swiftly & makes viewers reminiscent for a time when America truly WAS great in the eyes of the world.  

We see the two divergent paths of a married immigrant couple: a wife who remains true to her culture & Orthodox roots & a husband who sheds it all in the name of becoming a true ""Yankee"".  As in ""Wedding in White,"" Carol Kane offers an understated but moving portrayal of an obedient woman who suffers domestic abuse at the hands of a controlling, egotistical man.  Except this time she turns the tables on him & finds her happy ending.  Uniquely American issues like racial segregation & wealth-as-the-American-Dream are touched on in a thought-provoking way.         

<>Beautiful, seamless, emotionally authentic performances with such subtlety and honesty. Small, personal story with HUGE feminist-political agenda. Wonderfully directed. Such skill at recreating this period both visually and in performance.<>Yankel, a Jewish immigrant from Russia living in late 19th century New York, brings his wife (Carol Kane) and child over from Russia.  Yankel has assimilated (he calls himself ""Jake"") and his family's old world appearance and demeanor embarrass him.  He's much more interested in the owner of a dance studio who's much more American than his wife.  Joan Micklin Silver's feature film debut is a nice little film.  Shot in black and white and on an obviously low budget, it may not completely convincingly capture it's period setting, but it does an admirable job, and the human drama is mildly compelling.",Raphael D.

Nor does it fall too hard, though.<>The view Moselle gives us of this subculture is intimate and occasionally a little strange, but every second is captivating.<>Skate Kitchen is a highly realistic and believable narrative feature, populated with non-professional actors playing versions of themselves. Not much happens. What does happen is natural and relevant. And the film is terrific.","This film is a coming of age, adolescent teen based film set in NYC, about a group of girls in the skateboard community. It covers themes such as self identity, belonging and of course teenage rebellion. I thought the music used was quite good, it gives the film an edgier feel, without perhaps being relied on too much to make it feel actively overbearing as such. The cast do a good job - I thought it seemed quite realistic with the female characters being pretty frustrated and exasperated at times with the situations they find themselves in. 

Its a bit predictable or cliched in parts but it's not as bad as it potentially could have been, although I realise it won't appeal to everyone (some people may argue why should we care at all about somewhat bratty kids? etc.) but I thought it was at least somewhat immersive and not sugary sweet, disingenuous or anything like that. I suppose it's not especially great but it's certainly alright/fairly good and overall, yes I'd (maybe cautiously, as it won't interest everyone) recommend this film. Oh and I liked the tone of the final shot.<>It's so hard to do something unique anymore, yet somehow Skate Kitchen taps into a sense of freedom, into a subsect of youth culture, into a feeling of wistfulness unlike almost anything I've seen before. While wildly different in subject matter, I liken Skate Kitchen to Cooper Raiff's 'Shithouse' and 'Cha Cha Real Smooth' in that they evoke such a strong feeling of familiarity and sense of place that it is so easy to forget you're watching a movie. Everything about Skate Kitchen feels authentic. The actors all are actually skate boarders and seem like they came to shoot in their  own clothes, own hair styling, etc. As a result, the acting from 1 or 2 of them is not as good as it could be had those characters been played by more established actors, but what it is so marvelous about the actors all actually skating is that the movie flows effortlessly from action shot to dialogue to drama and back again. All of the story focuses on Camille, and she is an incredibly relatable character for me. Just a fantastic movie.<>Great Indy skater film, fresh and genuine.<>Good story. Great skate boarding scenes. Excellent seeing women/girls skateboarding and being in the center of attention.<>lovee, felt super honest, I like that it felt more of like how life is, just things happening, not just one dramatized story arc<>I watched the series on hbo before I watched the movie. I may not have liked the movie as much if I had not already been invested in the characters. I liked seeing where they came from. I really love this Now I want to know more about them. What are their lives like, what were they like when they were little. Where are they going next? Makes me want to get a skate board. Had to ask my kids how old they were when they skated. <>A visually enticing love letter to urban skate culture, Skate Kitchen uses its diverse female cast and interesting shots to show life as a young female skater in New York.<>I watched this movie hoping my grandson could enjoy it unfortunately the language was stronger than I thought it would be yes they are young adults acting but knowing the younger will watch it could’ve been toned down some along with the sex movies with skateboarding should be PG or PG-13 <>Movie night with Iris.

Skate Kitchen is a joy. A well-observed rites of passage story, and refreshingly a female one.

At the beginning the dreamy, sunlight shots had me a little anxious. Was it going to be another fetish skateboard film. Fortunately, not as it becomes a more deeper, engrossing tale. Skate Kitchen is about friendship, puberty, first love and jealousy. An urban tale but with beauty and joy. Top film.<>Skate Kitchen is a fresh take on growing up in the urban jungle, and is also a genuine love letter to New York and skate culture.","Crystal Moselle, Lizzie Nastro, Julia Nottingham, Izabella Tzenkova","Aug 10, 2018 limited",$236.1K,Magnolia Pictures,R (Language Throughout|Drug Use|Some Nudity|Strong Sexual Content),,,

[Full review in Spanish]<>A tremendous start to what would end up being one of the most brilliant careers in all of horror.<>Bava's sumptuous visuals remain, with the director innovative in his employment of multiple side lights to give scenes a luminous quality and make playful use of shadows.<>Swirling chiaroscuro, viscous rhapsody<>Bava and his crew's employment of unique camera angles, heavily atmospheric sets and startling moments of violence combine to create a trendsetting picture that has influenced generations of filmmakers (including Martin Scorsese and Tim Burton).<>...a melodramatic, thoroughly overwrought horror flick that's aged incredibly poorly in the years since its 1960 release.<>One of the cinema's preeminent examples of gothic horror.<>Though shot in black-and-white, it demonstrates Bava's extraordinary skill with light and motion and shadow, used to suggest unholy things.<>The most influential figure in Italian exploitation horror movies would never again match the success of this venture.<>The visual style still impresses, but the story beneath it has become too formularised for the film to retain all its original power.<><>It will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho.<><><>The gorgeous black-and-white imagery is so remarkable that it overrides the bad acting, barely coherent story and the awful dialogue.<>Mario Bava's first film is gorgiously photographed and often eerie, but it fails to scare much by today's standards.<>Visually stunning, black and white creeper.<>","One of the best Gothic horror (and Italian horror) out there with a perfect use of Black & white, melancholic dialogues and a surprising amount of gores. The very contrasted black and white puts so much emphasis on the actors' beautiful eyes that you can feel their emotion with their stares alone. It also works very well with the gloomy decors. There is just one short scene filmed differently (with a regular black and white) that took me out for two minutes. There is a lot of old school special effects there, some may feel outdated but they are still captivating and don't spoil the creepy atmosphere.<>It is sad to say that this old black and white movie from 1960 is still better than most of the offerings that I see on Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu currently. This film has neat old, spooky black and white photography and sets. Mario Bava is a great atmospheric director and was ahead of his time. Barbara Steele usually puts on a good show and does in this one. What cracks me up about these old movies is that they let the villain, usually a witch or evil wizard, ramble off this long curse upon the village and it's people instead of quickly dispatching them. It is worth a watch.<>Upon first glance of the title, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Black Sunday was another Tyler Perry/Madea movie to ignore, but no, it's one of the great successes of the Italian Master of the Macabre, Mario Bava.

I'll be honest, a lot of this film's plot and setting is heavily inspired by classic Dracula - the old European castle/village, a musty crypt, the characters that become enthralled by a monster, the pursuit of a beautiful woman, a creature in repose in a coffin, it's pretty familiar stuff. So where does Bava distinguish his film? It's in the atmosphere, pacing, and visuals; few films have so clearly captured the Gothic tone or aesthetic as well as Black Sunday, particularly in the initial establishment of the premise. There's a great balance of mystery, tropes, solemnity, and set design that creates a totally convincing horror narrative. There are weaknesses as the film ventures into almost Scooby-Doo territory in the last half-hour or so as the plot becomes more cohesive, with a series of hidden passageways and the ""gang getting split up"" to fall through trapdoors, but the early segments are so convincing that it's easy to overlook the later problems for the sake of enjoyment. However, the slow pacing and some of the inconsistencies may be a turn-off for some. 

Also, they couldn't just wait for it to stop raining to burn this witch? Nah, just confine her to a crypt with the very real potential to revive instead of planning the witch BBQ for next Tuesday. (3.5/5)<>I understand that these older films were limited when it came to design, make-up, effects, etc., but a movie can't rely simply on its story to remain a ""great"" piece of work. Sure, it may have a legacy that will ensure its status in the world of cinema, but that doesn't mean the film (as a whole) is any good. 

'Black Sunday' is a prime example. If this was made in the '80s we'd all laugh at it and call it a cheesy B-movie destined for obscurity. We don't HAVE to say something is great just because it is old, or was the first to implement a cinematic standard, or ushered in a new style of filmmaking. Perhaps it was something special back in the '60s, but this movie did not stand the test of time.<>The Mask of Satan it's absolutely a true gothic horror masterpiece it's really beautiful and scary experience by the great Mario Bava. <>1001 movies to see before you die.  This felt like a Hammer movie, B, melodramatic, but still entertaining.  The direction was good, just the story was weak.  Had there been a good screenplay, this could have been better.<>Mario Bavas debut Black Sunday is a stylish, beautifully shot Gothic Horror film, steeped in tons of character. It is well acted and has superb special effects for its time and can be quote frightening at times, it also has an unusual amount of gore for when it came out. Bava was clearly ahead of the curve here as he was several other times in his career. If you like horror, black and white, or anything of the sort this is a must watch.<>A pure gem ! Maybe the best Movie made by the italian director. Cinematography is awesome and so is the story and the atmosphere. Not to be missed. If you have to watch just one Bava, watch this one.<>A superb piece of Italian Gothic horror. 
Mario Bava's masterpiece featuring Barbara Steele at her finest, playing two central characters.

They have a disagreement about the split which draws the attention of a soldier, landing them both in jail.  Dilawar's devout uncle Ali(Ali Muhammed Dar) bails him out.  In the meantime, Bani(Taniya Khan) is looking to replace her stolen passport.

While lacking sorely in technique, ""Zero Bridge"" is still an engaging look at a teenager who is at a stage in his life when he is making tons of mistakes, not thinking that his actions might have consequences.  However, this does not excuse his uncle, whose whole life is built on hard work and has asked for nothing, handing down punishments that are on the verge of abusive.  All of this happens in Kashmir which is marred by violence, corrobated by news reports and the ubiquitous soldiers who keep people from loitering at a bridge, by force, if necessary.  In the end, area youth are left with few options if they want to stay.<>Kind of has an Italian Neo-Realism feel; about a guy and girl kind of stuck in poor parts of Kashmir and the lack of choices they have; his pickpocketing sort of leads to her problems....but they kind of fall for each other anyway--doesn't work out",,,$8.2K,,,,,

Pulham as he re-examines his life and especially his tedious marriage through flashbacks triggered by simultaneous contacts with a old Harvard buddy and an old flame. Robert Young is excellent as Pulham and Heddy Lamarr voluptuous as his old flame who is somewhat unconventional. Very good movie if a tad outdated.<>Tremendous script with sterling performances by Hedy Lamarr and Robert Young.   This is a tale for the ages, wonderfully crafted and performed.<>Lordy, Hedy Lamarr is gorgeous!  Robert Young is a man lives his life by what he thinks is expected of him and as an older man reflects on a period of time in his life when he met firecracker Lamarr who brings Young out of his shell during a brief time in his life. It's a charming and smart little film and Lamarr is very winning in what I now think is my favorite of her films. If she'd had more films of this quality, she'd probably be remembered alongside her contemporaries who appeared in more classic films. This film was actually Hedy's personal favorite of her films and I can see why. Ava Gardner supposedly has an uncredited appearance as a young socialite, but I couldn't spot her in the film.<>While imperfect, I found this to be one of the best and most truthful depictions of romantic love I've ever seen in a film.    And I'm a film buff, so I've seen countless attempts to portray romantic love.    Seeing this film, I realize how false and bland even really good films are when it comes to conveying the reality of the experience of being in love.     I won't name names, but even famous romantic films don't come anywhere close to conveying the beauty of love as well as this film does.     Robert Young and Hedy Lamarr have a marvelous chemistry, and their falling in love in conveyed believably.     In so many films, falling in love rarely seems to happen as it does in real life -- it so often seems arbitrary, forced, rushed, or simply false.

For feminists, this film might be interesting in that Hedy Lamarr is doing exactly what the female characters in Mad Men are doing(working in an ad agency), but in a 70 year-old film, and early on she announces her dream is to become a partner in her agency.    Her intelligence, strength, and ambition are treated as perfectly normal--even admirable--traits in this film from all those years ago.     By the end of the film, she *is* the head of a firm.     But along with these strong qualities, she conveys a touching vulnerability, and a childlike joy as she falls in love with Young.     It is easy to see how these two characters could find much to love and admire in each other.        All-in-all, a film to watch if you think romantic love is beautifully and realistically depicted in other films.    This one could change your mind.<>Solid MGM drama that contains probably Hedy's best performance.<>good period piece melodrama<>Funny how issues that are just so...dramatic today are underplayed here.  Old fashioned family values I guess.  Cute movie :)<>I have watched this film numerous times, but just can never get into it. Robert Young is such a bland actor. Hedy Lamarr is quite good, as is Charles Coburn and Ruth Hussey. Very nicely produced. But, the film lacks spark and verve.

Jimmy O. Yang: Good Deal,,,1 Reviews,0 Ratings,,,"Comedy, Stand-up",English,Marcus Raboy,,,,,"Jimmy O. Yang, Marcus Raboy","Too much of this hour covers territory any comedian, Asian-American or otherwise, could crack wise about.","Hilarious from start to finish. Good deal. <>Leaning heavily on the Asian stereotypes for content but for the most part to great effect. Honestly just a pretty good time.<>Let's be honest. When you saw this on Netflix, you said to yourself, ""How long will it take for Jimmy to crack an Asian joke?""

One minute and three seconds.

1:03. Let that sink in. 

Okay. Cant blame the guy for falling back on an easy crutch. Let's see his delivery.

Every joke felt very familiar to me. Nostalgic even. Like I may have heard all of this before. Like maybe Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock waaaay back in the DefJam days. 

The set ups and punchlines felt like they removed one stereotype for another and just left the framework of the generic race joke in place. 

While laughing at these newfound connections, I also noticed the way Jimmy walked around the stage and engaged with the crowd. Like how it seems that he shadows Chappelle too on his mannerisms.

I mean I'm sure he means well and it's flattery from one perspective, but to a marketable audience, it comes off recycled and boxed in a poor package at best.<>I'll never look at people doing Tai Chi the same again!<>Love this guy, but found this show to be mediocre.  Watched half and lost interest.<>Lui è sicuramente simpatico, il suo materiale in questo speciale è semplicemente normale. Niente di ché, una battuta sul fatto di essere asiatico dopo l'altra. Mi chiedo di cosa potrebbe parlare in uno spettacolo futuro. I cliché si sprecano, nessuna battuta particolarmente memorabile, non credo nemmeno di aver imparato niente di nuovo sulla sua cultura ed è strano perché ha parlato del fatto di essere originario di Hong Honk per un'ora di fila.<>In the few roles I have seen him in, I have thought Jimmy O. Yang is a pretty funny guy. I decided to check out his new stand up special, ""Good Deal,"" and I found a good amount of enjoyment in it. I found his jokes and stories to be funny and his delivery to be solid. A lot of the jokes in the special are Asian stereotype focused, which is funny, but I would be interested in seeing what else this comedian has to say. I liked hearing his viewpoints and definitely interested in seeing more from him in the future.<>It's been decades since we've seen a stand up comedian of Jimmy's caliber!  He's the real-deal, naturally funny and his quick wit will have you rapt and laughing the whole time!  I appreciate learning of his story (as 1st generation American) through his comedy, especially how he found his own way and stood-up to carving out ""himself"" figuring out what he wanted to do career wise following college!<>My wife is Asian so some of these jokes landed with extra laughs.<>Forced delivery.

This one gets Disneyfied as well, toning down the graphic footage and adding some mild personification to attempt to construct or implant a loose narrative atop all the action.

Samuel L. Jackson Binge: Jackson acted as the narrator throughout this doc and I would say nothing lost, nothing gained in describing his contribution. Now had they conjured up some human sounding voices for the animals SLJ could have really left his stamp on this.

But when he finds a traveling circus directly above the statue's location, he accidentally becomes part of the act. With a newfound passion for performance and an attraction to the beautiful acrobat Selena (Pier Angeli), Andrew must decide what is truly important to him.","Danny Kaye, Pier Angeli, Noel Purcell, Robert Coote, Salvatore Baccaloni, Michael Kidd","Merry Andrew (M-G-M) is the first film to be directed by Michael Kidd, and the latest vehicle for Danny Kaye. Unfortunately it is just that - another vehicle.<>The new Danny Kaye comedy isn't the best he has ever done but it's a genial and funny show.","Although Danny Kaye gives his usual good performance, this flick is far from his best vehicle. The songs don't have the memorable quality of Hans Christian Anderson and the plot is too simplistic. Circuses have rightly fallen into disrepute, since they treat animals so terribly with such cruelty, and this treatment makes them into psychopaths. Plus, the acts just cheap thrills, and clowns always made me uncomfortable, and for children they can often be scary. There is something rather tawdry about a circus and they have rightly fallen by the wayside, as has this movie.<>This Danny Kaye musical has our zany comic as an unorthodox English professor (with an on again, off again posh accent) pressured by his authoritarian papa (Noel Purcell) to be more like papa wants him to be. And he's gonna do it too, until a day trip to a nearby circus (home to cloying Anna Marie Pierangeli) changes everything. Predictable? You bet. First time director Mike Kidd keeps things moving overall though, but really comes into his own with the musical numbers, particularly the showpiece ""Salut!"", which is the main reason to see this, notwithstanding the comedy bits meant to showcase the only-a-moment-from-being-frantic Kaye.<>Late-cycle MGM musical is a typical Danny Kaye vehicle, giving him plenty of room to exhibit his shtick;  Michael Kidd directed and choreographed, with lackluster results except for one nice production number (""Salute"").<>I enjoyed it, but a feel good movie was long over due.<>Lackluster material mars this Danny Kaye vehicle.

We also get to see Steve on stage and on the road with his son who has become an acclaimed artist in his own right. The video of the performances isn't exactly quality but it does include a powerful rendition of 'Billy Austin, Steve's anti death penalty song. More of a snapshot than a chronicle but enjoyable enough.<>I couldn't bear giving this less than 3 stars just because it is Steve Earle, and the guy's work has never been about ""smooth and polished,"" but always about emotional intensity, uncompromising artistic integrity and thought provoking lyrics.

His facial expressions are enough to bring laughter to a fairly uneven film. The film often struggles in juggling it's sweet, everyman story with that of a political satire. One moment we are laughing as a boy is 'tortured', and see him light up a room of electrical equipment. The next scene has him dumped on the street, unable to walk...? It was confusing and kind of hard to take seriously. There's a lot to be gained from viewing this film though. Whether it be a few laughs, a peak at Korean history or just some wonderful performances.",,,,,,,,

The entire population of New York City disappears into space, not even one slumped over corpse?! Only one car for blocks, head on into a street sign?  Flesh incinerated, but newspapers blowing around, carefree, not even singed at the edges.

Amanda Knox,83,71,52 Reviews,"1,000+ Ratings",certified-fresh,upright,"Documentary, Crime, Drama",English,"Brian McGinn, Rod Blackhurst","Brian McGinn, Rod Blackhurst","May 23, 2017",1h 32m,"The trial, conviction and acquittal of Amanda Knox for the murder of an exchange student in Italy.","Amanda Knox, Curt Knox, Raffaele Sollecito, Giuliano Mignini, Nick Pisa, Stephanie Kercher, Brian McGinn, Rod Blackhurst, Brian McGinn, Rod Blackhurst, Adam Del Deo, Ben Cotner, Lisa Nishimura, Mette Heide, Stephen Robert Morse, Rod Blackhurst, Matthew Hamachek","Told as a story, the case itself is fascinating, however what makes it so compelling are the one-on-one conversations captured on film. <>Prepare to be terrified and infuriated as the filmmakers detail how an overzealous Italian prosecutor and a global tabloid press thirsty for a sensational story joined forces to wreck a young woman's life...<>Amanda Knox is a solid, refreshingly straight-forward look at this knotty case.<>No extra fluff is added to the re-examination of this story, from the simple stills of the apartment to the frank discussions each person involved has with the camera.<>Smart enough to ask its viewers why exactly they're finding so much enjoyment in watching this horror show unfold, this is true crime done right.<>But this movie is lacking a truly inquisitive eye, unwilling to go beyond the surface level of sleazy tabloid journalism that defined the case then and continues to now.<>What is certain is that the documentary is not interested in the people of color involved in the case.<>Rather, beneath the film's superficial status as a simple, factual summary of events, lies a tongue-in-cheek, cutting and ultimately chilling critique of sensationalism, selfishness and self-delusion.<>... fundamental sensationalism bubbling under a patina of seriousness, exemplified by cocoon-like, squarely composed, quasi-Errol Morris interview sessions...<>The powerful new documentary ""Amanda Knox"" emphasizes the spike in awareness of sexism just since 2007.<>Amanda Knox has been gussied up with dramatic music and slow-motion camera effects that reinforce the notion that it is entertainment. This, of course, is an insult to the memory of Kercher, who died horribly and is dead forever.<>Eventually, the missing pieces -- and the Amanda Knox case is undoubtedly one of missing pieces -- outshine the compelling elements the doc does provide (again, Amanda Knox! as primary talking head!), leaving audiences only wanting more.<>Directors Rod Blackhurst and Brian McGinn do a good job of keeping things balanced and of illustrating the ways in which sensationalism can be misleading.<>Compelling true-crime story.<>Unfortunately, Amanda Knox veers more in the direction of reproducing a sensational story rather than providing valuable analysis of it.<>Amanda Knox constantly toys with the idea of viewer perception and pre-conceived notions, knowing that even the smallest glance or crack in one's voice can be interpreted to ""prove"" innocence or guilt -- depending on what you want to believe.<>For a viewer who chose to avoid the salacious, never-ending TV and tabloid coverage of its namesake, Amanda Knox makes for succinct, involving viewing.<>It is a film that will arouse more tension and suspense than the other works of action and mayhem out this period.<>Docu on sensationalized murder trial has graphic depictions.<>While [the documentarians] deserve plaudits for convincing Knox to talk to them, they hardly miss a chance, themselves, to exploit both her looks and her tears.","The Amanda Knox documentary is a balanced look at a sensational story. True crime fans will be in their element getting to hear the story from the horse's mouth. It'll leave you with plenty to ponder.<>This was a really interesting documentary that goes behind the headlines that I was reading just a few years ago to tell the true story.<>I knew nothing about this and was actually expecting a bigger story. It's hard to sympathize for suspects who change their stories and pass the blame, it's happened many times in cases. I almost at some point just say to myself ""lock them up for saying stupid confusing confessions!"" But, I am aware that law enforcement can use this public perception to their advantage and use time and words to mess with the suspects. For future suspects of crime - speak the truth and stick to it no matter how ridiculous or embarrassing it may be.

The media guy was a joke, it's his duty to ensure his sources and info are legit.<>Amanda Knox was smart, beautiful, and a free spirit. And all of these worked against her. They tried to suggest that because she liked boys and sex that must mean she's guilty.<>Dubious PR for the self-pitying and rather irritating Amanda Knox, who notoriously was charged/acquitted/charged/acquitted of the savage murder of fellow student, Meredith Kercher, alongside boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. The elephant in the room is the extraordinary lack of respect or sensitivity shown by most of the protagonists towards Kercher, nowhere more clear than in the glib strutting of a so-called journalist with the hilariously appropriate name Nick Pisa. The documentary this aches to be has yet to be made.<>This is a remarkable story and yet another example of how the justice system — this time in Italy — can treat people so badly.  Even though we know the outcome, the story is riveting from beginning to end. One of the things I like about a lot of recent documentaries is the way they use footage without third party commentary interviews of people not involved in the story. Obviously, the way a documentary maker puts together a story is affected by their perspective. But, at least, the viewer can form their own opinion recognising that there will always be other perspectives that different people involved may have. It does, however, seem that this documentary is presented in a balanced way. Obviously, we may never know the absolute truth about some cases like this; but at least it casts an incisive eye on the events which raise some reasonable doubts and exposes the way the media can distort and sensationalise events in such a way that individuals often don't obtain a fair trial. There's one reporter, Tony Pisa, who is particularly shameless in describing how he used this case for his own professional ego promotion. The other thing this documentary does very well is never let us forget that one of the victims in this tragedy, Meredith Kercher, was murdered. The death of this young woman was the ultimate tragedy in this story. Engrossing viewing.<>A pretty good documentary, it showed both sides of the case but its pretty clear how flimsy the local police and prosecutor's case was against  Amanda. They focused more on the gossip, intrigue and rumors than what the facts really say. 

I mean, why did they have to obsess on things like her sex life when they could've all that energy to instead look at the case more objectively? There was absolutely no traces of biological evidence of Amanda and Raffaele on the actual crime scene, that should have been more than enough. 

Anyway, a pretty entertaining documentary and a Must Watch for me.<>So much better than I expected. <>Well this situation is clearer now after this documentary than before...I have read other Amanda Haters dis on this documentary and still profess her guilt...so, the movie did walk a tightrope trying to present the facts, not too many of the facts, but enough to prove that there is EXTREME criminal action on the part of the Police, and the idiot, wanna be Sherlock Holmes, Prosecutor/Lead Investigator GIULIANO MIGNINI...
I liked this documentary, it was riveting, and it ultimately showed that there was no case against Raffelle and Amanda...my problem with it, and ultimately with Amanda herself, is how the documentary does not show how Amandaï¿ 1/2(TM)s actions shifted the investigation onto her, by her truly bizarre behavior(in general, not just after the murders)ï¿ 1/2
For all readers interested in this story, and why you simply cannot even remotely think Amanda and Rafaelle killed Merideth, for there is no proof, no DNA and no ï¿ 1/2motiveï¿ 1/2Â?ï¿ 1/2 the admitted murderer and his truly excellent sleeze  bag lawyer are the keys to unraveling one layer of this incredible story.
Here are the facts:
1.)Rudy Guede did it, and he admitted he did itï¿ 1/2he is in jail for doing it(unfortunately due out soon)ï¿ 1/2his first Skype call interview totally exonerates Amanda and Rafaelle.
2.)Judge Hellman is a hero.
3.) Murderers do not travel to their murder scenes with a professional knife kit and return with their knives just partially cleaned and pop them back in their kitchen drawers...oh yeah, that knife with Amandaï¿ 1/2(TM)s DNA, as she was partially living with Rafaelle, and a cross contaminated speck of Merideths DNA, ï¿ 1/2was the wrong sizeï¿ 1/2Â?ï¿ 1/2hello after that set of headlines why did the press not have that in a headline?ï¿ 1/2 because MIGNINI would pop them in jail...yes, pop reporters into jail for months if they did not write what he liked.
4.)Not recorded!!! Hours and hours of grueling interrogation, but not recorded????ï¿ 1/2you bet this was recorded, and all that has to happen is a copy of that to get out and MIGNINI and the Perugia Police and those special interrogators from Rome will all go to jail where they belong...

DNA cannot be manipulated to appear on a Bra Clasp but not on the rest of the Bra, or the body, or anywhere in that room.
Amanda never bought bleach as the newspapers stated.

What was false news read by the populace was never step by step reported as false  in this documentary, and it is a shame it wasnï¿ 1/2(TM)t ...but Judge Hellman summed it up beautifully in his 100 plus pages of poetry in the appeals trial exoneration explanations....read that...educate yourself, and you will understand what a complete embarrassment MIGNINI, the Flying Squad Police, the original forensics team, and any Judge who convicted these two spaced out kids.<>The movie cover is far more compelling and intense than the documentary itself. Amanda Knox maintains job interview like behavior as she lazily tells her story. Amanda Knox, the documentary, feels like a coordinated public relations stunt. It's tightly edited, completely emotionless, and brushes over the substantial evidence and victim, Meredith Kercher. The documentary is not particularly convincing either way.","Mette Heide, Stephen Robert Morse",,,,,,,

One of those Django clones. That alone gave me some preconceptions about this film which happened to be totally wrong. 

This film would probably be better of having nothing to do with the Django name. It could stand alone without any ties to Django...and it practically doesn't have any, save for the name of the character.

This dude is really a badass. The film begins with him dropping a cross with a villains name on it and the date. His MO, tell you exactly when your gonna die and make it happen.

I like this guy. He's peculiarly thin, but still tough, has a beard and practically haunts the films antagonist. Also par for the course is his dark get up complete with poncho. 

Oh did I mention it has slight horror qualities. Yeah, he's presumed back from the dead, and appears in walls of smoke and darkness...yes this is cool. The film is practically his killing spree. Not really any gore but a less spiritual version of High Plains Drifter...with a bit more spaghetti thrown in.<>As a spaghetti western time waster Django The Bastard is a fine  way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  In that respect it's good but is it as good as the original Django w/ Franco Nero?  Hell no.  There's so many sequels to Django it's sad.  This one should have just been called The Strangers Gundown & stood on it's own legs.  It could have but the fact that it tries to pass itself off as a Django sequel I hold a lot against it.  Actually I should watch High Plains Drifter w/ Clint Eastwood again because this has a lot in common w/ it..just not as good<>The Second best Django Movie and the perfect Combination of Italowestern and Horror this Django is the darkest and morbidest he is more frightenend than Freddy, Jason and Michael Myers together Antonio di Teffe is a really creepy Guy<>This unusual horror film is one of the best examples of the spaghetti western genre. The plot is the standard ""lone stranger seeking revenge,"" but in this instance, it's not clear if the stranger is a man or just a ghost. This aspect of the story, which is heightened by spooky music and scenes in fog-filled cemeteries, really sets this film apart.

The soundtrack is also excellent, with lots of distorted guitars and sci-fi organ music.<>It's been a while since I saw this one, and I remember being a little disappointed. It's entertaining at times, sure but for the most part it was just daft and corny. I think a lot of that could have been due to only being able to watch the dubbed version (very, very distractingly bad) but I dunno. I'd like to give the proper version a watch I guess, but for the most part the thing that sticks out in my mind is the badass title song. In fact, I'm going to track that motherfucker down right now. Thanks, memory!<>Like a deadly panda, Django eats, shoots and leaves. Well actually he doesn't do any eating in the film but he sure does do a whole mess o' killin'!  In the end though, it's still a formula western with a little bit of a ghost story mixed in -- think, grim reaper comes to town.<>Revenge killing is almost as ubiquitous as bounty killing in these flicks, huh?

Luciano Rossi (in his sixth Django film!) as the white haired, sickly pale veined Klaus Kinski freekazoid Jack Murdok steals the horrific thunder in this overwrought, plodding revenge epic. 

While Anthony Steffen cuts a pretty good poncho box as the anorexic gunfighter, Django (a role he would reprise two more times - including the pure shitfest W Django (aka A Man Called Django), he strains toward the end of the picture under the weight of the fumbled script. 

Some truly good things about this movie involve the nasty means of dispatch and the overt sadism shown - particularly whenever Rossi cracks a wide tooth laugh and levels his pistola. Some truly awful things involving refugees, a never-ending set of chases and slasher-esque tropes as Django prances about in the shadows, gunning down or blowing up cowboys.

I enjoyed it, even if there was a stupid subplot of woman and some cash money and the potential life that Django could lead...which I suppose was added to deepen the horror/ghost story/fallen devil motifs of greed and temptation.  

Overall, not so shabby Django picture.<>Creepy western with Anthony Steffan duplicating Eastwood's acting.  Is Django a ghost?  Or is he simply the most bad ass gunslinger of his time?  Watch and find out.  The noose scene is magnificent.","Herman Cohen, Anthony Steffen",,,,PG,,,

I often just go to a web site and pick a film they feature. This one was made in 1992, and the first thing that came to mind when watching this film, is didn't Japan have Cell Phones in 1992. I am sure they did. Anyway its a B Type Movie, some call it a Eighties Slasher Flix, but I can't put it in that category, as there was very little slashing.

[left][font=Palatino Linotype]The basics: A small art dealership opens and is quickly in need of some expertise on the art itself. Imagine that! A young woman responds and gets the job and discovers the office is home to a [i]hands-on[/i] boss, a [i]yes-man[/i], a scatterbrained owner, along with a couple of real good people who love art and delivering on their client's needs. The blood begins to flow (literally) during a second storyline where one of the building security guards confronts a subordinate over billions lost, and yet unpaid, to the former. There's no chance he's able to repay. For reason never explored, a near 7-foot former Sumo champion (not the morbidly obesce sort either, a fit & trim 7 ft., and crazy a hell), the third wall of the building's security triangle, snuffs out the book-maker.

(1998) Backlash
THRILLER

  Straight to rental and low budget, and seen it as ""Backlash"" and not as ""Justice"" about young female federal prosecuter succeed in putting away a drug Colombian drug cartel for life , only then she is on the run because of other releatives who're also connected and in the drug business. Interesting on the first half with some amusing dialogue, but goes to the absolute ridiculous and predictable mode where she ends up having an affair with an informant.  So many far fetch things happen after, is when it really becomes ridiculous and off the wall.  James Belushi also stars in this as the informant!

Be forewarned that's the whole film.  There is no violence, no car chases, no sex, no bad-taste jokes ... just razor-sharp dialogue and two show biz veterans at the top their game.  I spent much of this two-hander debating who is the better actor in this effort.  I finally ruled it a draw.  It's a treat to see Gleason dial it down, as he did in ""The Hustler"" and ""Requiem for a Heavyweight.""  It's also a treat to see Olivier play an outraged ninny, yearning to turn back the hands of time so he can punch out Gleason for carrying on a long-term platonic affair with his wife.  If you decide to watch this movie, it's a tough one to track down.  It was an HBO original in 1983 and is officially available in only VHS.

Keto and Cochrane are treasures.<>Mostly unimportant, but it moves along at a decent pace.  Basically just check it out if you want to take a quick peak into the daily life of a random group of Bohemians circa 1970s.  Interesting cast though.<>This director us terrible.<>I watched this because I'm a relatively new Simon Baker fan, and this is one of the few options currently on Netflix with him in it. 

The storyline of Sunset Strip has potential, but it was hard to follow, moreso in the first half.  The second half was better. Musical performances by actors Tommy Flanagan and Nick Stahl were  highlights.

The main story is with Tammy, played by Anna Friel. She was quite a character. She's a stylist, a fashionista who dresses musicians, actors, or whoever for a color coordinated, fashionable, and hot look, circa 1970-something. Apparently, she's overly popular with her male clients and easily willing to give them a little extra in the dressing room if that's what it takes to keep them happy and coming back. She's good at what she does, busy, and popular.

Simon Baker's character, Michael, is a photographer who is friends with Tammy. He's in love with her, and she doesn't know it. He's around and helps her out as needed, but she doesn't really see him, too busy trying to keep happy her demanding and famous customers.

Meanwhile, one of Tammy's famous clients has fallen for her. He wants to bring her back to the UK to be with him. It would be a high rolling lifestyle for her, but she'd have to leave behind her business and depend solely on his love.

She becomes aware of Michael's feelings thanks to a friend of his, someone Michael saves from an overdose. Now she has a decision to make: drop it all and go be with singer Duncan (played by Tommy Flanagan) or stay and be with Michael.

In addition to Tammy's story, there are several other short stories mixed in.  The one that caught my attention is about Nick Stahl's character Zach. Zach steps out into the backyard to play electric guitar for the neighborhood and someone somewhere down the hill answers back. They just might be going somewhere with the dueling guitars.

Randall Jahnson, writer for The Doors (starring Val Kilmer) was involved in this, and I can see some similarities in these 2 movies. Both stories feature musicians and a gritty look at drugs and sex in a 70s music scene. 

There's a story here, but Sunset Strip comes across as being in need of some work on timing and transitions, mainly a big issue with editing.<>Although Sunset Strip is colorful and includes a decent script, but they cannot make up for the films multiple flaws. It's jumbled, pointless, overly busy, and leaves too many unanswered plot points.<>***Due to the recent RT changes that have basically ruined my past reviews, I am mostly only giving a rating rather than a full review.***<>Pretty weak overall, but friel was cute. Mostly I didn't care for the characters and their relationships had almost nothing to do with each other. Then they tell us where people went with their lives in thirty years bringing back small characters that were not important to the plot. I was left confused and uncompelled. But Maybe that's what the 70s were like? In that case they succeeded.<>I enjoyed the acting (Nick Stahl, Jared Leto...)<>Well, not really realize pop history in 70s L.A. but the flick is kinda ok with senses off humor. Solid acting cast including Anna Friel, Nick Stahl (in fact it is most probably his most lovable performance), Adam Goldberg & Jared Leto.<>The acting is solid but the writing is all over the place, lacking form and focus and leaving the movie in a narrative mess.  There's also a tonal problem in that it's too dramatic to be a ""madcap"" comedy, and just a tad too loose to be a drama; if the story were properly focused, this wouldn't be a problem, but as it is, the whole film just comes across as half-baked.","Art Linson, John Linson","Aug 18, 2000 wide",$3.9K,20th Century Fox,R,Flat (1.851),"Surround, Dolby SR, Dolby Digital, Dolby A, Dolby Stereo",

The fact that everybody loved Betty Grable so much in the 40s is extremely evident, everything in it just is not that good, and the only reason I felt to watch it was the great looking Technicolor, and the stars that were very popular at the time. This movie didnt seem like a musical to me, there really isnt that many songs or dances, which was definitely a downer, and the 3rd billed Carmen Miranda should have been listed last considering her total time is probably five minutes. This was her first movie, which is probably the cause, but its too bad to have to miss the bubbly fun she usually brings into her movies. I just wish there was just a little more routines and lines from her, she delivers great! ""Down Argentine Way"" isnt that great, so if you want a good musical with Betty Grable, get ""Springtime in the Rockies"", not this.<>Light, colorful and very entertaining with a terrific cast.

I didn't even have a reason to watch it, but I did and now you don't have to.

The animation is great: colorful and fluid in every scene.<>Movie was good until second act when yellow car exploded :(<>I'm not sure how university admissions are conducted in Japan, but ripping up an acceptance letter doesn't just ... rescind the offer. Somehow that's a plot point in this movie. 

I can't call myself a longtime fan of the Lupin III series, it's never made the rounds in America in the same way that it has in Japan. My only prior experience with the franchise comes from Castle of Cagliostro, the 1979 film that served as Hayao Miyazaki's feature directorial debut. However, it's a juggernaut of a property, with seemingly endless adaptations and narratives in print and film alike, all built around a relatively formulaic design; a likable, capable, and goofy protagonist with a series of companions proceeding through a rotating cast of adversaries and adventures that usually leave the crew about where they started. Characters and relationships don't really change, but that's part of the point; it's animated cinematic comfort food. The franchise knows what it's about, and while the plot and particularly the villains feel somewhat lackluster and the film stalls a bit towards its conclusion, The First is still a charming film that understands the humor that makes the franchise work. If there's a larger criticism, at times, it feels a bit less like a Lupin III film and more like an action-adventure, focusing surprisingly on the 'visiting protagonist' rather than the main cast, and giving off action setpieces and plot twists that are a bit more reminiscent of the Spielberg Adventures of Tintin, or even (shudder) Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. While other Japanese studios, notably Ghibli, have tried to make the move to 3D animation in what has largely been perceived as a misguided effort to keep up with the times, this first attempt to bring Lupin to the current visual style actually works quite well; the animation is pretty fluid and used to exaggerate the character features accordingly. When this movie is firing on all cyinders with the charm, it's hard not to get caught up in it. 

Honestly, I just love hearing Inspector Zenigata shouting ""LUPIN!"", it's essentially a Tom & Jerry routine, with the same level of endearment. Need to find time to dive into the past 50 years' worth of movies that Lupin has inspired. (3.5/5)<>This was my first look at Lupin III as I wasn't familiar with the series or the storied franchise, but I thought the movie was quite adventurous with this group of characters. I look forward to the next installment as I'm sure it will continue.<>I never thought that the CG adaptation of anime will be nice<>Proving that in the right hands, a long-running hand-drawn franchise can in fact look great when translated into CGI, the springy antics and historically-amiable fun of Lupin III are back and still swinging from the days of ""The Castle of Cagliostro"", but this time with a final act that gets more in over its head even by the expected standards.<>esta película es totalmente genial y con mucha acción<>Real fun, great animation!<>Lupin III: The First is a perfect movie that brings a popular character from 2-D to 3-D animation.

I'm fairly confidant the origin of this movie is Hong-Kong, though it has the distinct flavor of lesser Japanese grindhouse flicks, and it makes a passing reference to an 80's attack on a South Korean fishing vessel by Argentina. The cast was never seen again (as far as I can tell) and I don' think the movie even listed a director (much like the Hooked on a Feeling Hasselhoff video).

Quite trashy with very low production values, but you know this going in - this is, after all, a B-grade exploitation movie.  However, Turkey Shoot is pretty bad even by that genre's standards.

Basic, lame plot.  Really not much too it.  There is some intrigue about how the prisoners escape their ordeal, but it becomes quite predictable, quite quickly.

Some incredibly stupid, implausible scenes - the writers and director weren't even trying to make things seem realistic.  For example, man has his legs crushed by a bulldozer.  Blood magically starts gushing from his chest and mouth.  Now I'm no doctor but that seems medically impossible.

Then there's the performances.  They're largely of the ultra-hammy variety, with the actor who played the whip-cracking chief guard particularly bad.  

However, Olivia Hussey puts in a good performance, especially considering the script and direction she had to work with, and is about the only good thing about the movie.  She looks distinctly out of place in this movie, being a decent actor and having starred in movies like Romeo and Juliet and Death on the Nile.

The parents of these children are hero's particularly Daisy's mother her house was burn'd down and she looses her job.

For example, the prosecuters and the sheriff kept saying there wasn't any evidence of sexual assault even though they had actual, filmed testimony from the boys saying they did have sex with them and knew they were minors, and then also the film identifies the rape kit and medical examination and yet that was basically thrown out of the case. Also, the detective handed over the phone that possibly held video evidence to the perpetrator to turn the phone off, which he more than likely deleted the video right then and there. I am absolutely horrified that not only was any of this examined further, but then they interview the sheriff who was obviously biased and discrimanoroty and insulting to the victims, and they don't question him on it. Also, the timeline was hard to keep track of. I was going to rate this movie much higher, but I am so disgusted with those parts of the film...<>- Audrie & Daisy are the stinging voices of sexual assault -

""The words of our enemy aren't as awful as the silence of our friends.""

Audrie & Daisy is a documentary that challenges America to talk about teen sexual assault and the escalating assault that social media inflicts after the initial crime.  For most of the movie, the bottom of my stomach and the top of my throat were doing figure 8s.  It's a harrowing subject and filmmakers Bonnie Cohen (The Rape of Europa) and Jon Shenk (The Island President, Lost Boys of Sudan), whom are partners in life and this film, handled it with confidence.

Today we can no longer pat ourselves on the back for knowing that the word ""rape"" is one of the most egregious things you can do to a fellow member of mankind. Personally as a man, and together as a collective, we must prevent it.  We must be quick to console the victims and with the same swiftness, punish the perpetrators.

This seems like a sensible solution for one of the most ancient crimes of humanity, right?  Yet, we continue to back the criminals and persecute the victims.

Audrie & Daisy follows two cases from opposite sides of the US that took place within eight months of each other.

Daisy Coleman was the tender age of 14 went the assault took place.  She and her friend left a sleepover to join her brother at a party.   It should have been just a simple adolescent night of drinking.  But there, her brother Charlie Coleman's older friends sexually assaulted and filmed Daisy and her friend.  Daisy was left on her front lawn where she was found by her mother the next morning.

All of us at some time in our youth, have walked to the edge to check the resilience of our balance.  But in Daisy's case, a predator pushed her into the pit and she hit every ledge on the way down.

Daisy was bullied and tormented on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.  She was called a slut and a liar.  She was blamed for being at the party.  She and her family were gruesomely tormented.  The torment unfolded online through cyber-bullying and in the real world as the Coleman's house was burned down.  The Colmans experienced the depths of a cyber-hell. This is a classic example of when freedom of speech goes horribly wrong.

Audrie & Daisy focuses on another young girl as well, Audrie Pott.  Audrie was only 15 at the time of her assault.  I wish someone had continuously whispered ""high school doesn't matter"" tenderly in her ear.  But sadly no one did.  Consumed by the hell of being sexually assaulted while being unconscious and then ridiculed by her peers, she took her life.

The tone and approach of Audrie & Daisy were leveled and considered, including the altered names of the suspects in Audrie Pott's case to protect their identity. Directors Cohen and Shenk walk a journalistic tightrope, unable to sway too much, knowing that the spikes of subjectivity lie beneath.  They had better temperance than I would have.  I would've jumped in the spike pit.

The first spike I'd jump on would be the Maryville, Missouri police department.  Stomaching the police department's rhetoric in defense of releasing the dehumanizers who viciously destroyed Daisy Coleman's essence, was hard to take.  The Maryville, Missouri police department blamed Daisy and accused her of lying, although the little devil admitted to the crime.

It's fair to say that I was incredulous through the entire documentary. Honestly, I wanted to turn it off because it was just awfulness after awfulness. This story has happened to so many women around the world. Audrie & Daisy shows that the victims had no support, no love and their lives were in shambles. Frankly, it was discouraging.

But I didn't turn it off.

The survivors, these warriors, these resilient women, Daisy included, somehow made it through the tempest. They not only made it through their own apocalypses but somehow banded together and became a positive voice from a hole of utter blackness.

Whatever they're doing now, I hope that they keep speaking, and I hope that their voice spreads like a wildfire - for their sake and everyone else that can relate to the experience of victim shaming and blaming.

This one looks mannered and gimmicky.","Excellent movie that kept me engaged throughout trying to figure out the connection between the separate story lines.  Great acting and a great cast.<>Extremely sad. Was rooting for Elizabeth. Overall great movie.<>I had no preconceptions or expectations coming into this, and while the narrative may prove a stretch for some, I found it both engaging and, at times, touching.

This reminded me of the type of movie with large casts, who are loosely connected by a wide ranging plot, that we saw a lot of in the early 2000s, such as Crash, and Innaritu's 21 Grams or Babel. I thought early on this was definitely headed in a particular direction, so was surprised when it veered at one point and offered a much different, and probably more affecting, conclusion than I had anticipated through most of the film. 6.5/10

Samuel L. Jackson Binge: It is safe to assume based on this title the main focus would be on the mothers in this film and, along with a cast this strong, I was surprised Jackson made the strong impression he did in his smaller supporting role.

SLJ January #52<>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This is a film a man could pass without realising what a priceless drama they walked pass in a rush to watch Hobbs & Shaw, (as this very man nearly did) 'Need-less-to-say.. Including any action movie I've seen this year, This is a gem 💎 I could watch over and over again.. This is not easy viewing for those with big kind caring loving hearts, as this movie's storyline (which challenges a tough, complex emotive and controversial subject) 'Adoption'  is so authentic to life, with, in my opinion, life-time performances played out by spectacular actors and actresses who are ALL SO (F) AMAZING  - In each of their roles.. If this movie does not win a string of awards (obviously Including an Oscar) There is no justice in the world...!! I have to say though, Annette Benning steals the shoe with her ever lasting floorless breathtaking performance leaving this big G in absolute tears.. This is hard hitting bitter sweet reality bites drama, and not for the faint hearted, however, written and executed with pure genius on all levels... This is definitely a movie you can watch with the family, or romantically realising how precious life is, and more importantly, how the decisions we make in life can be so profound, sad, and indeed content... ((WooW)) 💔😪❤
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<>A beautiful, unsentimental drama about relationships; independence; womanhood; adoption; love; fragility; humanity. Wonderful performances from the three leading ladies make this such a joy to watch. Brilliant work by Rodrigo García<>Great pro-life movie! Adoption not abortion!!<>Interracial dating propaganda. Any film that depicts a beautiful white woman like Naomi Watts in a sexual relationship with a black or any other type of non-white man, is essentially propaganda, aimed at convincing white women that interracial dating and wiping out their own race and European beauty is OK and not taboo.<>This brilliant film explores the depth and scope of loss and redemption poignantly but without sanctimony. Too many contemporary stories portray birthmothers as stock characters indistinguishable from one another as human beings, linger in the delivery room, and presume there is a  universal range of responses to surrender. 
Instead, ""Mother and Child"" focuses not only on the birthmother, but on the many lives touched, intersecting and only occassionally interwoven by the birth and adoption of one child. The actors are skilled and exceptionally well-cast, and the script is not burdened with smarmy cliches. 
Birth and death pass as swift, transient events in ""Mother and Child"", reminding us that the swaddling and shrouding are seconds long - and the substance of life is everything in between. 
The women - the birthmother, her mother, the daughter she surrendered, the adoptive mother, and their mothers  - are distinct, separate individuals whose lives are variously affected by adoption, absent or engaged, but always independent. ""Mother and Child"" is only disappointing in ending with Munrealistic images of closure, that seem contrived in these characters and most improbable in real life.<>Poignant story about a woman who gave up her child for adoption at a young age. Mother and daughter lead separate lives. The mother upon discovering her daughter's death she reconnects with her granddaughter later in her life.<>The sins of the fathers, or mothers and the lost and found lives.

The ending credits tell it best so I won't spoil it, but what I will say is that one of the film's best qualities is the raw expression of the dance between suffering and hope, failure and success.  With each win no matter how small there was always the potential for great loss always gnawing at this family.

Overall, very watchable, the cast is great, and even if you can't figure out why they're doing what they're doing, they seem to know. If you like a clear plot and story arc - this is not for you!

Alonzo, Frank J. Urioste",A typically worthless early effort from Brian De Palma...<>It's some of the seldom-seen UFOs in Brian De Palma's career that can dramatically alter one's perception of his work.<><>,"An odd but funny, obscure De Palma film.<>This early effort from Brian DePalma  has drugs, magic tricks,  female nudity, and a Orson Wells cameo,  now if it could  only make a story appear out of all that mess they would really have something here.<>the day the earth stood still<>A bizarre nugget from director Brian DePalma's early career, ""Get to Know Your Rabbit"" lands halfway between Woody Allen's concurrent farces (""Bananas,"" ""Sleeper"") and the many late-'60s comedies (""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas,"" for instance) where a ""straight"" drops out to experiment with the subculture.

Tom Smothers is Donald Beeman, an executive marketing analyst who turns exasperated with the corporate grind, quits his job, moves to a fleabag hotel and takes lessons to become (ta-daa) a tap-dancing magician. His teacher? Orson Welles, of course. A pitiful string of bookings in sleazy bars follows, but Donald is happy to be living his dream. Along the way, he meets a beautiful gal or two, including groupie Katharine Ross (who must have been asking herself how her career so quickly plunged from ""The Graduate"" and ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"" to this silly flick). Familiar faces Charles Lane, M. Emmet Walsh and Bob ""Super Dave Osbourne"" Einstein also pop in for random scenes, while the always wonderful Allen Garfield has a solid part as an overbearing brassiere salesman. And John Astin is Donald's needy ex-boss who becomes a crucial obstacle to the righteous, unfettered life.

From the start, it's obvious that ""Get to Know Your Rabbit"" is too absurdist to have any real satirical bite. The plot makes less and less sense as it goes (just how many cut-rate magicians can the marketplace handle?) and, except for a couple of overhead tracking shots, the film has the aesthetics of a bland sitcom rerun. Smothers is a likable star, but his magic skills fail to impress (partly by design, sure). He does allow himself some racy moves that wouldn't pass on television, such as briefly exposing his genitals (too far away from the camera to be notable) and squeezing naked breasts.

""Rabbit"" is a fun little romp, but viewers seeking DePalma's comic side are much better off finding his previous film, ""Hi Mom!""<>Brian De Palma made a name for himself with his independent films Greetings (1968) and Hi, Mom! (1970), with that, Warner Bros. offered him a Hollywood film with this lighthearted satirical comedy about the madness of the rat race and how we want to escape it. It was shelved for 2 years after wrangling and uncertainty about how to sell it, shame really. Successful businessman Donald Beeman (Tom Smothers) is sick with being stuck in a Nine to Five routine, having to keep to deadlines and the punctuality and repetitive nature of his work, and one day, he just gets up and walks out, quits his job and trains to become a traveling tap dancing magician under the teachings of Mr. Delasandro (Orson Welles). Meanwhile, Beeman's boss Mr. Turnbull (John Astin) is desperate to get Beeman back to work, but it eventually costs Turnbull his job, he's now a drifter and Beeman employs him as his business manager, and while Beeman is travelling across America, Turnbull's new company grows to become one of the biggest corporations in the World, Tap Dancing Magicians (TBM). It is very much like a Richard Lester comedy, with very surreal humour carrying it along, but it has hints De Palma's technical trickery that he would used in Phantom of the Paradise (1974) and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). Smothers is a likeable presence and he holds his own against pro's like Welles and Astin, the result is one of the best kept secrets of the 1970's.<>A periodically amusing early curiosity from master director Brian De Palma that felt empty, shallow, despite all the quirkiness.<>Get to Know Your Rabbit is an early comedy of Brian De Palma's which is a fantastically ridiculous.  It follows a dissatisfied business man (Tom Smothers) whom leaves his job in order to become a tap-dancing magician.  This film revels in its absurdity, and its a just a lot of fun.  De Palma loves his overheads and tracking shots in this film, and they work well, creating this absurd surrealism.  Orson Welles even shows up as the business man's trainer, when he wishes to become a tap-dancing magician. It's a relatively small part, but Welles is great as always.  The more I hear people say they think De Palma is overrated or sucks, the more I believe they just havent gone deep enough into his early works.  De Palma may be known more for his early 90's late 80s fare, but in my humble opinion his best work came in the 70s and early 80s.<>Low-key, odd but consistent comedy starring good-natured Smothers as an office drone who seeks an escape the grind of corporate life and Astin as his boss who tries to follow his lead with schizophrenic results. Tim Carey is hilarious in a brief bit.<>Awesome.  Another de Palma classic.<>There's not enough here to rank it with the best of De Palma's satires (Hi, Mom and Phantom of Paradise, if you can consider the latter that), but it's such a bizarre movie that it kind of works almost in spite of itself.  De Palma's got a lot of verve with his direction, which is to be expected, but any moment with Orson Welles is awesome and there's a few really genuinely laugh out loud moments here.  It's really one of those near ""lost"" movies that not surprisingly never really found an audience.  It's a true oddity, and I mean that as sort of a compliment (sadly De Palma got fired during editing, though maybe it's not hard to see why).",Steven Bernhardt,,,,R,,,

Interesting to compare this with the later Smiles of a Summer Night, a much more polished and finer realized glimpse at three relationships.<>I suppose the film was pretty different in 40s touching topics like abortion, suicide, lesbian as well as emotional and personal depth of the character. As a whole,  it had good dialogs, interesting relationship drama.<>In ""Thirst,"" Rut(Eva Henning), a dancer, loves Raoul(Bengt Eklund).  She is heartbroken when he tells her he is married with children.  Even worse, is when the Mrs.(Gaby Stenberg) shows up at their apartment unannounced.  At least, her next relationship works out better, as she gets married to Bertil(Birger Malmsten), an assistant lecturer.  So while they talk about their finances on their honeymoon, she also relives the torment of a botched abortion that has left her sterile.

Three years into his directing career, this is more like the Ingmar Bergman we are very familiar with.  Sure, a lot of ""Thirst"" is pure melodrama but there is also a lot of metaphysics included here in this depiction of a radiply changing post-war Sweden.  In fact, this seems positively provocative not only for then(what with one character being a lesbian and all) but maybe even a little for today, framed around not condemning Rut for having an abortion and ending with a conversation involving a minister who seeks to reform the notion of marriage, with the chauvinistic Raoul being the villain of the piece.  While there is one great scene involving a crowd outside of a train, the editing leaves something to be desired as the scenes involving Viola(Birgit Tengroth), Bertil's ex who might have endocrinitis, no elephantitis, no wait, encephalitis, feel like a different movie entirely.  And either all of the characters are from the same social circle or Sweden has a really small population.<>the film starts a bit slow and meanders through the first half, but when it picks up it becomes a very interesting character study involving such difficult topics as suicide and abortion.  bergman flexes his visual style in new ways in this film.  overall very interesting.<>Thirst is an early Bergman film which demonstrates his potential. The connections between characters are decent but I found the situations, character reactions, and dialogue to be over dramatic. The ending does a good job at bringing together some of the themes of the movie.<>""Thirst"" is one of Bergman's first films the Director made and is a complex and detailed look into the lives of several troubled and isolated characters.  The film utilizes four different narrative structures in which the various characters are within and yet all are connected through their despair and longing for something more.  The film captures the characters and their problems, both with one another and with themselves in such an intricate and personal way in which only Bergman could capture.  While not quite up with his masterworks you know you are watching a Director more than capable and advancing in the field of cinema at a rapid and yet refined pace!<>This very early Bergman is certainly not his best, after all he didn't write it, but this story of sometimes confusingly overlapping loves and losses is told with a flourish of stylistic directional choices and an incredibly self-assured use of the camera, giving us a taste of the enormous genius soon to come.<>Interesting and well-shot melodrama about a pair of couples (but mostly one.)

I really liked the concept of the film and the fight scenes.  Overall, I liked it even though I was confused some of the time...<>Dream of a Warrior
Starring: Leon Lai, Park Eun-Hye, and Lee Na-Young
Director: Park Hee-Joon


Dean, a Soul police detective (Lai) starts having strange dreams of a beautiful girl being menaced by monsters (Eun-Hye). He is soon assigned by his superiors to help Dr. Jang, a researcher working on time travel experiments. Dean learns that the girl of his dreams is the doctor's daughter, who he, in true mad scientist fashion, used as the test subject in one of his experiments and ended up stranding her in a distant time and place. Dean is the only one who can save her, and soon he too is sent long ago and far, far away, to the world of Dillmoon where the last outpost of cilization is being menaced by evil madmen who wield second-rate computer graphics as their primary weapons!

""Dream of a Warrior"" is a fantasy movie that wants to be a sci-fi film. Or maybe it's a sci-fi movie that wants to be a fantasy film. Whatever it is, it's a hodge-podge of ideas that don't mesh very well. Most of the film consists of the story of the final days of Dillmoon and the last incarnations of Lai and Eun-Park as the doomed lovers, Dean and Princess Rose. 

In fact, the whole time travel concept is such a small part of what goes on that it's almost extraneous. However, add to the mix a group of cultists that appear early in the film who warn about dire consequences when Jang's experiment links our world to Dillmoon (who then never reappear, and whose predicted dire consequences never pay off), as well as the fact that Dean isn't the only character in the movie that has a counterpart on Dillmoon, and the time travel aspect goes from a ill-fitting add-on to a sword-and-sorcery fantasy film to a convuloted and ill-conceived twist.

There's an average time-travel/eternal-warrior love story that's been smashed together with an average sword-and-sorcery story in ""Dream of a Warrior"", but the combined total is something that's less than worthwhile. Maybe the 100-minute version that was released in Hong Kong and Korea makes more sense, but the 87-minute international version (the one I viewed) was entertaining but severely lacking in any decent pay-offs from its disparate elements.<>Nice Korean action flick.<>A confusing and very messy film. The plot involves time-travel, alternate universes and possibly reincarnation. I dunno, it was hard to keep track. The film had some unique visuals. Unique in the sense that it was made in the 00's and looks like it came out of the 70/80's. I'm pretty sure this is mostly on purpose. It looks old and even the music sounds like pieces of cheesy piano solo's and synth action beats. The performances come dangerously close to soap opera standards and it all has a thick layer of cheese that is hard to cut through. And as we all know cheese is pretty soft, that's HOW cheesy this film is. It was intriguing at first as I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Then I realised, if the film didn't know what it was doing, then my chances were slim.<>matrix cover but way orig k-sci-fi fantasy adv w/enigmatic leon, pretty eun-hye park, na-yeong lee. ambitious w/rich myth, concepts and romance but majorly budget and time constrained. also, the direction's sometimes far too hokey.<>not that bad i guess. only watched it because of my fav actress Park Eun-hye.<>High concept stuff unfortunately let down by the constraints of its low budget.<>The intellectual blend of budhist ideologies with colorful science fiction and matrix style martial arts create a highly philosophical and heart touching movie.<>One of cinemas masterpieces",,,,,,,Surround,

At one point, he was a big part of the British New Wave, making movies like What's New Pussycat?, Nothing but the Best and The Caretaker.

Luv wasn't well-received by critics, but I think it was just the inevitable backlash against what the old guard was told was the next new thing.

The story begins with Harry Berlin (Jack Lemmon) about to jump off of a bridge before he is distracted by an old friend he barely remembers, Milt Manville (Peter Falk), who can't stop bragging about how good his life is. Harry has a plan, though. He plans on leaving his wife Ellen Manville (Elaine May, who went on to write many a romantic comedy) and hopes that Harry can take care of her when he's gone.

The problem? Milt and Ellen love each other more than they love their new spouses, so they try and get Harry to fall for Milt's Linda. Either that or he's going to have to really jump off the bridge.

I kind of love the poster for this, which panders to hippies, who were all either avoiding theaters or waiting for Easy Rider.<>The cast and director try their best, but the script is terrible and this is an awful, awful film.

The remainder of the film consists of alternating scenes of the fur trappers dragging a large boat over a seemingly hostile terrain and Zach struggling to make his way back to civilization.  The performances are good, as would be expected by Harris and John Huston, and the cinematography nicely shows off the spectacular scenery, but the film is marred by annoying flashbacks, some odd POV shots early on, a cloying music score, a laughably absurd scene of a reborn Bass reading a bible quote to an injured rabbit, and an ending that is sickeningly sentimental.<>No, this is not good. Which really sucks, seeing as you have both the great Richard Harris and the brilliant John Huston. But, Huston's greatest strength was directing, which unfortunately he did not do in this case. The actual director, Sarafian, made several little known films of no real regard, then worked mostly as an actor. So no real surprise that the movie isn't better, but the screenplay by DeWitt is also to blame.

Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo,,13,2 Reviews,100+ Ratings,,spilled,Horror,English,Stuart Hagmann,,,1h 40m,Townsfolk unite against spiders freed from a crashed plane's coffee-bean cargo.,"Claude Akins, Charles Frank, Deborah Winters, Sandy McPeak, Bert Remsen, Pat Hingle, Tom Atkins, Howard Hesseman, Charles Siebert, John Harkins, Noelle North, Penelope Windust, Lanny Horn, Jerome Guardino, Matthew Labyorteaux, Stuart Hagmann, Paul Freeman","This gets off to a fine start but then has nowhere to go but down.<>Although the budget is modest and the made-for-TV editing is evident, the acting is surprisingly decent and the use of real tarantulas is welcome.","Beyond directing The Candy Snatchers, Guerdon Trueblood was the king of writing insect movies. Ants!, Terror Out of the Sky, The Savage Bees and this movie, all within two years is how he did it.

Directed by Stuart Hagmann, Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo pulls a switch on you as you've been led to believe that Tom Atkins and Howard Hesseman are the heroes as they fly out of Ecuador with a huge haul of coffee beans that just so happen to be filled with spiders. Yet after they crash in Finleyville, California, the movie shifts to the townspeople battling the furry eight-legged creeps, including Dr. Hodgins (Pat Hingle), Bert Springer (Claude Akins) and Cindy Beck (Deborah Winters).

The town is more concerned about selling oranges than dealing with the spiders until it's nearly too late. The solution: make the sound of wasps so that the spiders stop moving, then dump them into buckets of alcohol.

Also: these aren't tarantulas. They're Brazilian wandering spiders.

That said, I'll let a silly TV movie play all day long, like a warm blanket when it's cold outside. It is my joy.<>Killer tarantulas, oranges, and wasp sound that freeze spiders. This movie is ridiculous. It's just to bad that it is also beyond boring.<>""Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo"" is a critter feature that offers no scares and little thrills. While the acting and sets are good, the story moves too slowly and the spiders aren't used in any creative or inventive way. We always see the tarantulas simply crawling on the ground, which isn't frightening. Spiders are frightening because they can crawl on walls, hide inside little objects and appear at any moment; by using mostly static tarantulas (which are spiders that are easily recognizable and commonly known to be harmless) the scares simply don't happen. A long portion of the introduction is wasted on the setup where we meet characters that are simply killed off a few minutes later; precious time that could have been used to develop our main characters and make us care about them. Overall the film is dull and audiences won't be scared or excited to watch it and although there are a few jokes at its expense that can be made, even as a ""so bad it's good"" kind of film it's not terribly entertaining.

All the actors seemed bored and not really wanting to participate and I can understand them, because the movie was soooo boring.
There was barely ANY suspension at all, why would I care that some unnamed B-characters get killed by spiders they are too stupid too notice?
I hate to say it, but the spiders actually seemed kinda cute... it was just too obvious they weren't going to hurt the actors.<>Zero fright factor, but surprisingly decent heckle value.

Wasn't to keen on the scarecrow design but the soundtrack rocked.<>(***): [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/icons/icon14.gif[/img]

A fun, low-budget slasher flick.<>Not to be confused with Dark Night of the Scarecrow, the made-for-TV film that I reviewed recently, Night of the Scarecrow is a supernatural slasher film that follows the return of an evil warlock in the form of an evil scarecrow.  Night of the Scarecrow is not a great film by any means, but it features some inventive death scenes, an entertainingly twisted villain, and a few creepy moments.<>I can't help that I have a soft spot for killer scarecrow movies.<>Not bad, as scarecrow movies go.<>Actually one of the first horror movies I saw when I was younger. It's pretty stupid, a little funny at times, but not much entertainment.<>Director Jeff Burr (Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw 3, From A Whisper to a Scream, Pumpkinhead 2, Puppet Master 4 & 5) may be create the best horror movies in the world, but they are certainly effective and get the job done. That being said, I feel as though he is slightly underrated, especially after shelling out this small mid-90's gem, about a particularly creepy scarecrow that is animated by the tortured soul of an old time witch who was murdered by the townsfolk. Now, he's after the ancestors of the family that slayed him, which is the Goodman family, made up of the town farmer (Dirk Blocker), the town Sheriff (Stephen Root, from King of the Hill and Office Space), the town preacher (Crispin Glover's dad, Bruce, who's just as loony as his son), and town mayor (Gary Lockwood). It's up to the mayor's daughter (Elizabeth Barondes) and new boyfriend (Joe Mese) to stop the killer scarecrow before the entire town is destroyed. While the leads are ineffective, the supporting cast really manages to entertain. Also, with Burr, there's no shortage of violence and gore to his films and Night of the Scarecrow is the same way, offering up some pretty violent and bloody deaths. This is a definite gem and should be given a DVD release! Fun film.<>saw the preview on www.fancast.com it looks really good and scary. lot's of action.","Barry Bernardi, Steve White",,,,R,,"Stereo, Surround",

The total film is only mildly interesting in the way it is presented.<>It never makes the case that a movie about Bob Zellner is intriguing let alone necessary<>While its intentions are pure, like its protagonist, this historical drama is too didactic and heavy-handed to provide much meaningful insight into its true-life subject matter.<>The fight for equality isn't over, and this story is as relevant today...<>A movie that misses the point of what the civil rights movement was about.<>Confrontations, riots, plus [Bob] Zellner's recollection of his own weak moments when he couldn't muster the courage to protest illuminate the historical significance of that era as well as the timeliness of the story.<>Executive produced by Spike Lee, Barry Alexander Brown's drama features fine performances across the board, and a vivid evocation of a tumultuous period.<>A massive failure on the part of Bob Zellner and those whose stories got weaved into this cheesy after school special. They deserved better.<>For all its noble intentions ... Son of the South never quite figures out its purpose.<>A pretty old-fashioned, unimaginative contribution to the filmography on the civil rights struggle, but it's earnest and instructive, and a tribute to one of its unsung heroes.<>Accepted on its terms, the film does a reasonably absorbing job of dramatizing how Zellner's convictions strengthened, pulling him away from the security of inaction.","Far too ignored by the public, this true story of race relations is extremely powerful and really effective.<>Not a bad biopic of the first Southern white man to join the Student march for equality.  Portrays prejudices against him by both whites and blacks but he holds his own and becomes deeply respected.  One of the white guys killed down there was from my hometown but I was only born at the time.<>While I have grown weary of stories of civil rights injustices / struggles, this was reasonably well done.<>Entertaining but I would have preferred if it were more serious. There are moments in the movie that felt like should have been more meaningful but the quirky comedy of it took away from that. However, that WAS the intentional tone of it, and I'll admit that it makes the story elements more palatable. It can be very difficult to watch things about the history of racial injustice in this country, and by making it irreverently comedic, it makes it easier to watch. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing though. It also ended kind of abruptly.<>Es una película decente y no merece la mala crítica que recibió; la trama es pasable y la actuación de Lucas Till es decente; es recomendable.<>Beautiful. Beautiful film. It is clear that Lucas Till, Lucy Hale and Lex Scott Davis are Oscar-winning stars in the making, and I think it'll be a major injustice if they fail to be nominated for their respective performances here.<>The fake Southern accents are just the starting point of how bad this movie is. For such a real and serious moment in history, this film's dialog, character interactions, musical score, and acting make extremely light of the situation. Not sure who thought this was a good portrayal given today's race relations. Bad take. Even made Rosa Parks look dumb.<>A simplistic sample of how Zellner teamed up with the Freedom Summer Project, I think the character's portrayal lacked a little more depth.  It is quite admirable to see his transition from a white boy, privileged and rule-follower to a brave activist aware that a revolution was needed, but Zellner's story has a gigantic potency that has not been deservedly instigated here!  In theory, it is relevant, but not enough!<>A poignant and personal look at how the civil rights movement of the early 1960s prompted a young white Alabaman to recognize his own humanity and act on it. This film could serve as a good start for those seeking to learn about the movement.<>I feel somewhat the same towards this film as I did to last years The Last Full Measure with the main similarity being that it's heart is in the right place but it doesn't do a lot to distinguish itself. The message of this film is inspiring but it's a message that's told in most films relating to the Civil Rights Era. The performances were all around decent. There was one bad performance but most everyone else did a good job with what they were given. The script is okay at best. Like I said, the script doesn't do enough to make this film stand out and the dialogue is mediocre at best but not terrible. In terms of cinematography and music, it's average. Nothing special about the music or the way the film is shot. There really isn't too much to say since it doesn't do a lot for me. It's got a good string foundation that just doesn't build off of it that well.

I can't in good faith tell you to see it, but I'd be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy it.<>The basic premise of the film could have made for an engaging and far-out watch. The very concept of the Rapture could have been depicted with power and mystery, but instead the opposite is achieved in a film that just looks slapdash.<>Overt Christian messages and Cage's omnipresence are not the only reasons why Left Behind is a terrible movie. And yes, it's indeed terrible-god-awful, a less interesting, more convoluted version of the original Left Behind.<>This new film is a watered-down and somewhat changed version of the earlier movie with a bigger budget and not much else. There is barely enough undercooked scriptural theology to critique in the vacuous writing and painful acting.<>There's no drama. No suspense. No real stakes, even, because most of the movie takes place after the Rapture already happened.<>The effects are hilarious, the sets are rinky-dink, and the character names are funnier than a full season of 'Big Bang Theory,' and the ""narrative arc"" of our heroine is laughably predictable.<>The only prayers Left Behind inspires are for Nicolas Cage's career.<>Ostensibly an exploration of biblical themes, Left Behind avoids any theological debate to revel unsuccessfully in the mass-hysteria created by God's Rapture.<>I never thought I'd write this, but Kirk Cameron's Left Behind, flawed as it is, looks and sounds better in almost every single way.<>Outlandishly inept in every way, 'Left Behind' is easily one of the worst movies of 2014.<>My goodness, what on earth is Nicolas Cage doing in this movie?<>A very circumscribed, boring thriller that director Vic Armstrong hobbles with a very quiet, non-urgent tone throughout.<>The first movie made from this material was all about the Anti-Christ taking over the UN. This one's about landing a plane.<>I am now relatively certain there is a Hell and it is a darkened theater with no doors showing Left Behind on a loop for eternity.<>Faith-driven audiences deserve better...<>The movie unravels in its own destruction. Every effort to milk the tragedy of the apocalypse is met with terrible music, acting and effects that soak (and drown) the pathos in camp fare.","This movie was so bad that my TV couldn't handle it! Generic music, nonsensical plot, lack of buildup. It's no wonder why absolutely nobody talks about this movie! It's so bad that it's good!<>Even if you believe in the Rapture, this movie stinks.<>I feel a lot of people are super mean about low budget films. Because of critics like these low budget films sometimes don't get made. When the low budget films are the ones that need to be made to spread the good news. In this case… I though the fact that Nicolas Cage took this portrayal as an actor (whom choose their roles) was pretty cool of him. You rarely see big time actors take on Christian world view roles. For the sake of a community that might not have otherwise watched this type of film. I personally do believe the rapture is going to happen, also any day now for the time and seasons of this age are present and all around us. The Bible is 1/4 prophecy in a whole and most people don't realize that because people don't want to talk about that anymore now days (prophecy fulfilled btw). It is called the blessed hope for a reason it is an escape of the coming wrath of God for an evil and Christ rejecting world. 
If you did like this movie Kevin Sorbo just made its sequel recently. It really hit home to how the world has changed in the last few years. Which has brought the Christian view of pre-rapture and end times theology to life and ""real"" in the way the world is headed currently!!<>whoops, wrong movie. Delete this please<>The greatest movie of all time<>This movie is nowhere near as bad as the critics want you to believe.

That said, this movie isn't as good as the original.  And that is saying a lot!  It does have some good tension in the second half of the movie.  But for a Christian movie, it has very little Gospel in it, most of what is there is regulated to the ""nut jobs"".

Not much character here, the movie focusing on the disaster...what there is of it.  You just want the movie to be better than it is.<>Out of the Rapture topic of films out there, this one is perhaps the better one regarding the biblical topic of what may happen when Yeshua (aka Jesus the Jewish Messiah) calls out and takes out all the believers and followers on Earth. I like how a bit of humor was woven into the storyline.<>Ein solider Action Film von Nicolas Cage mit einem spannenden und gleichzeitig fragen aufwerfenden Ende<>What I liked is there is plenty of action and it deals head-on with the essence of belief and takes on a plot idea that is rarely or never approached. Nicholas Cage as usual is totally and enthusiastically committed in the role. Gotta say - other reviews I have seen are tough - seem to mix up their own views on Christianity with a movie about Christianity.<>I'm very surprised that I actually liked it. Given the subject matter, I was worried it was either going to be too pro-religion with lots of ""preaching"" or too anti-religion and just a hate fest against religious folks. But instead the movie focused on the characters and how they dealt with the immediate dangers that they faced. There's not much of an arc for anyone as it's played mostly as an action movie. It felt like they might've been setting up for a sequel where some of the characters would find some sort of meaningful change, but sadly that doesn't happen here and there's no sequel I can find. But I did think it was an enjoyable and entertaining way to pass the time. Nicholas Cage is great as usual, Cassi Thomson was very good and believable as his daughter, and I was really surprised at how good Nicky Whelan was as the flight attendant that Nic Cage's character is having an affair with. That character could easily have been a typical clichéd ""evil other woman"" and ""flight attendant from hell"" who hates her passengers. But Whelan (and the writers) make her very real and interesting. There's some unnecessary, and thankfully brief, subplots on the plane, but overall I found it a pleasant surprise.","Paul Lalonde, Ed Clydesdale","Oct 3, 2014 wide",$14.0M,Freestyle Releasing,PG-13 (Some Thematic Elements|Brief Drug Content|Violence/Peril),,,

This was one of many films in the early 1960s to explore Greek culture and the humor that can be found in it and it's success arguably spawned Madalena (1960), Alice in the Navy (1961) and Zorba the Greek (1964). The film's critical and financial success translated into four Academy Award nominations and as I am attempting to watch the performances of every Best Actress nominee ever I stumbled across this film.

Lively Greek prostitute Ilya, Melina Mercouri, plays by her own rules as she only sleeps with men that she likes, holds lavish parties for the men in town on Sundays and refuses to bow to the commands of her overbearing landlord. Her life is disrupted with the arrival of American scholar Homer Thrace, Jules Dassin, who is obsessed with all things Greece and has traveled to the country to explore the moral decline of society as he believes it can be traced back to Ancient Greece. He comes to believe that Ilya represents all that is wrong with modern society and sets about attempting to reform her after being frustrated by the fact that she ignores parts of classical Greek tragedies she dislikes and has no intention of settling down. She agrees to be taught by him for several weeks and the men of the town are dismayed as they no longer have entertainment on Sundays and Ilya becomes downtrodden. When Thrace partners with No Face, Ilya's tyrannical landlord who tries to extract high rent prices from her and the other prostitutes in town, he is discovered and Ilya and the men of the town turn against them. This leaves Ilya to commit to Tonio, Giorgos Fountas, with whom she had been falling in love while Thrace admits that he had lusted after her all along but is now unable to sleep with her.

The real appeal of the film comes from Mercouri's lively performance as she is what westerners think of when they imagine the stereotypical ostentatious Greek woman, an idea that has been replicated in My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). She is particularly entertaining when she theatrically performs what she believes the plot of Medea to be as she uses her entire body and enchanting dark eyes to draw an audience member in. We understand why all of the men in town would be in love with this woman as Mercouri convinces as a carefree bright figure who has never thought to consider whether her actions are unbecoming to a more conservative man. Part of what makes her so enchanting is how the director, the man who loves her, shoots her as he captures her as though she is a fifty foot tall goddess. I believe that Mercouri earns her Best Actress nomination as she makes the film, which is otherwise rather slight, worth watching.

Beyond Mercouri the film doesn't have much to show for itself as the Greek scenery is obviously beautiful but Dassin is not the first to display this on film and the comedy is entertaining enough but nothing feels particularly unique. The romance between Ilya and Tonio was sweet enough but it is only really represented in one scene and it would have been nice to see this more fleshed out. The conflict for Ilya over maintaining her autonomy and carefree lifestyle and potentially achieving lifelong happiness with a man, something that she cannot rely upon, could have been a fascinating idea to explore. Instead Dassin jumps from one joke about Greek culture to the next as Thrace is reprimanded for drinking coffee and encouraged to consume copious amounts of ouzo and is then terrified by the sight of a man smashing bottles on the ground. These jokes are mildly diverting but they don't come together to form a satisfying whole and at the end of this film we are left with the knowledge that Mercouri is a real comedic talent but probably won't remember much else about the film.<>What a joy!  No car chases, no special effects, no stunts.  Just good script and good acting. Illia's joie de vivre is contagious and Homer's cluelessness made me squirm.<>Kinda fun.

ON DESERTING
Shuttle busing a murder of LA kids out to the Mojave Desert and attempting a musical happening, Desolation Centre was the first punk version of Woodstock. The bare bones year one operation featured Savage Republic and the Minutemen, proveing successful enough to entice New York scenesters Sonic Youth, german industrial experimenters Einsturzende Neubauten, and mad scientist Mark Pauline blowing shit up, to join in on the action.

This was the early eighties, and though the rest of the world was chiefly unawares, the Desolation Center projects proved very influential, and pointed directly to such gargantuan beasts as Lollapalooza, Coachella and Burning Man. Luckily photos were taken, footage was shot, and many people survived to retell the tale. The resulting documentary, if a bit scrambled and rough, does a nice job of capturing the yahoo artistic explosion of a new generation looking to create their own identity, their own scene, their own happening. 

Stuart Sweezey, who organized the festivals, also directs this doc, and thus offers crucial insider information, but very little distance from the source. It all sounds pretty cool and fabulous and often outta control, and maybe it was, but the film really works best when some of the outsiders like Thurston Moore (who came cross country because he was such a geeky fan) and Blixa Bargeld (who remembers almost nothing) have their say. 

Desolation Center works as an historic document, a surprising bit of entertainment, and a look into a time and place few people knew or cared about, but should have.

Unfortunately, while the film does have a decent, but cheesy, story about Henri realizing that love isn't a bad thing or something that only happens in fairy tales, it is still a fairly predictable and safe attempt at this story.  Much like What A Man, another film by Matthias Schweighofer, it works because of due to Matthias' likability, even when his character is a person who, essentially, breaks up couples.  Milan Peschel is also likable, but his character was designed to be that way and to give Matthias something weird and crazy to play off of.  The film also doubles as a bromance and while it is a little goofy and over-the-top, the leads' chemistry is obvious and it makes the film a little better to watch.  I don't really have much to say, this is a German romantic comedy that doesn't really offer anything different than what we're used to in this side of the world, but the final product is decent at best.  It has its moments, but it's far too predictable and sugary for my tastes.  It's an easy film to watch though, it doesn't require much brainpower to understand what's going on.

You will her on to settle down, but on her own terms.<>Abhishek Bachchan is sweet as paavam-bechara Robbie, though a little dull. Vicky Kaushal nails the externals of his character with great pizzazz, but has little to chew on in terms of who the man really is.<>Aided by smart writing and affecting performances, the film subverts the nice guy trope and squashes the idea of the one true love.<>A rollicking if predictable rom com, where all the expected notes are hit up to the guaranteed happy ending.<>Even as it acknowledges its inspirations, Manmarziyaan strikes out in decidedly different directions.<>For a film that waxes eloquent about the unpredictability and volatility of love, the end feels like an unnecessary cop-out.<>It is ultimately a disappointment not because of its craft, but because of predictability, self-indulgent pace and its irritating attempt to be both a light crowd-pleaser with a cutesy ending as well as an impassioned, volatile romance.<>Like love, this film is messy and flawed and glorious. You have to sign up for all of it.<>Put a ring on Manmarziyaan, you won't regret that choice.<>The performances by Taapsee, Vicky and Abhishek are special, to say the least.<>It's Abhishek Bachchan's Robbie that is by far Manmarziyaan's most interesting character.

There are two many vacillations in the plot and it's about 45 minutes longer than it should be, though.<>Stupidity, waste of time<>An underrated gem of a movie.<>While I don't know why it's international screen name is 'Husband Material' which sounds so bizarre that it is ultimately bland, what I can tell you about the film is that it deconstructs the complex layers of love, fucking love, bloody love and many other modern forms of love today. Only, the craft here is of the director who has in credit gangster dramas like 'Gangs of Wasseypur' and 'Black Friday'. So we see why it's not an Imtiaz Ali movie: there are dark, grays in its characters and their layers... but it is also not bereft of poetic touch which might be the most fierce thing about it.<>If I could give this movie negative stars, I would. Undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen till date. Yikes<>Manmarziyaan is a romantic comedy, I was enjoying the movie in the beginning with its fun and laughs, but as soon as the Love triangle was introduced plot and storytelling went out of the equation. There is a saying Love is blind, in the movie they go on to show how blind, dumb and absurd it can be. The cast and their performances were good but not good enough to save the movie. <>Not a classic but still entertaining. Just a normal movie, appears to me this was an attempt to gross some money for a future project by Anurag Kashyap. Although the storyline was unimpressive but the music was fantastic. Really good job by Taapsee and Vicky, Abhishek anyway hasn't really been impressive for a while. Definitely a good attempt to portray a modern love triangle with the complex moralities involved along with a quirky sense of humor. The story however needed much more work to really surprise the audience since the topic of love is so cliched that unless a writer really gives the story a personal touch it doesn't really appeal to you. The story also had major flaws like Vicky's exit in the end is completely ridiculous and the ending is totally bullshit, a more suitable ending was like that of La La Land where the protagonists part ways. I would probably not watch this again by myself but still a good movie to watch again with a bunch of friends.<>Hindi film evolution could be tracked by these stories where a girl does not or cannot marry someone she loves, is forced to compromise, struggles to forget the per-marital love but eventually ends with the husband. From Sangam to this movie, there are at least five if not dozens such movies, and many a reflection of their eras. Manmarziyaan surprises throughout and beautifully presents the current realities with lovely characters.<>Mind blowing, trendy, best movie of 2018<>as usual, this movie peaks at so many places, hitting such right chords, creating such emotional punches, being so rustic, being so musical, being so kashyap at its truest!","Vikas Bahl, Madhu Mantena Varma, Vikramaditya Motwane, Aanand L.

Law, Mike Nelson",Không có review của nhà phê bình,"This is a low-budget documentary on the obscure topic of wiener dog racing. This film shows off some trivia and history of the sport with some controversy over the little pups involved. The whole thing is scatter shot and despite some scattered funny moments, I can not really recommend it to anyone other than the dachshund obsessed.<><i>Weiner Takes All</i> seems like the kind of oddball documentary that Errol Morris could have made. It's about the highly competitive world of dachshund racing, the ridiculously political world of dachshund dog shows, and the overly-enthusiastic humans that are arguably more important to the events than the dogs are.

The movie begins with a stupid joke about Wienerschnitzel, but soon after makes up ground with a montage of people talking about the dogs. ""They get belligerent,"" one woman complains, ""they've powerful."" Another man claims that there is steroid use in the races. I couldn't help but wonder whether this was real or if it was some kind of strange comedy.
As far as I can tell, it is real. The movie mostly follows the trials of several different racing dachshunds -- starting with the famed Noodles/Pretzel rivalry (which we've all heard about in school), talking about the monster dog named Barron who never lost a single race and was eventually told could not race anymore due to his constant wins, and along the way getting to know the people behind the scenes who are rabid with support for their dogs.

They treat the dogs like human beings, pampering them and making sure that they are trained for the races. When one dies, his owners reserve an entire room of their house for his trophies, newspaper clippings, and the urn where his ashes are kept. It's one thing to see your pets as a part of your family, but this is just crazy.

But the movie is played mostly for laughs, so look at it more as entertainment than education. In regards to the dog shows, one judge says that you will ""lose fifteen points if the dog has no head at all"". Was he being serious? No, couldn't be.
And when a couple of dog owners at a dog race are asked how they feel, their answer is: ""A little hung over.""
It's difficult to tell where the line between jokes and reality are. Was the sport of dachshund racing really spawned by a Miller Lite commercial, or is it a convenient bit of humor? Were dachshunds really killed during World War I due to being of German descent, and were they really briefly re-named ""Liberty pups""?
Whether these bits of info are true or merely bits of humor is unclear, so the best way to look at <i>Wiener Takes All</i> is just to sit back and laugh at the way the people and dogs act. It's hysterical to see the dogs running toward the finish line, only to scatter at the last moment and run around in circles. And the dog owner's devotion to their pets is oftentimes incomprehensible.

<i>Wiener Takes All</i> is kind of scattershot: it begins with the dog racing, cuts to a dog show in New York, goes back to the dog races and then to strange history of dachshunds and dog racing, then back to the races again. It doesn't have a natural flow to it, making it feel more disjointed than it really ought to have. And though it was often funny, sometimes the filmmakers were trying much too hard to be humorous (a la the aforementioned wienerschnitzel cold open).

It's fun, the dogs are cute, and that's all.","Marion Law, Shane MacDougall",,,,,,,

I wish they made movies like this now.<>Johnny Eager has strong acting performances across the board and pretty good dialogue, but the movie lacks a proper noir atmosphere and it jettisons its inherent crime elements in favor melodrama and romance, which wasn't a good choice.

Both Robert Taylor and Lana Turner are not what I would call great actors, but more ""pretty people"" who look mesmerizing on the silver screen. But director, Mervyn LeRoy really gets greatness our of these two, along with a great supporting cast.  For 1941 this was a pretty off center story that didn't have pure good and pure evil characters.  Yet it didn't feel like Noir to me, which is usually pretty heavy handed.  Though the plot twists weren't surprising to me, I'll bet many were when this great film first came out.  I was impressed and would  happily see it again in the future.<>Interesting.

saw again on the movie channel 12.26.2021<>Nothing special but the acting is strong.<>Wow! The sexual energy between Lana Turner and Robert Taylor shoots off the screen. Taylor serves up a fascinating portrayal of a sociopathic mobster. Van Heflin is interesting, too, as a close friend with repressed homosexual feelings for Taylor.

Chávez, Roger C. Sherman, Nancy Selby","A painfully atrocious would-be thriller with some of the worst directing and acting you're ever likely to see. William Shatner is amazingly bad, and the little blonde girl is even worse. Truly hideous.","What's really the strangest part of this movie - beyond the bizarre direction, the hokey acting, the hilarious outfits, the lame dialogue and the snooze-worthy plot - is the movie's assumption that ALL children (at least every child in this film) have an Oedipus complex. And that leads them to go from jealous to stabby in like, boy, 5 seconds. I want to know what happened to the writer in their past that caused them to write such an out-there concept. In a way, this movie is so bad it's watchable, but at the same time if you miss it like, you're probably better off. 
Bonus points for the unintentionally hilarious scene where Shatner punches a dozen balloons and berates a stranger for carrying them.<>Low budget junk that managed to rope in Ruth Roman in the cast. She was far too good an actress to be stuck in trash like this. Shatner chews the scenery shamelessly.<>William Shatner plays a psycho-killer in a not uninteresting thriller.<>Wow.  This is a movie that is only fit for viewing with a large group of folks who are together for the express purpose of honoring and mocking William Shatner.  Thematically, this movie suffers from a miserable script and piss-poor direction to go along with the extremely questionable acting skills of the cast.  Technically, it's a textbook example of how NOT to edit, light, or film a movie, or mix sound, for that matter.  It would be redeemably funny if the chase scenes (most notably the one through a car wash and the one through a funeral parlor) were filmed with the intent to amuse, but I suspect not.  Riotously bad, but riotously funny with the right company.  I hope I never have to watch it again (or, if I do, that copious amounts of wine are also involved).<>I must say that I love this movie.Being a fan of Shatner,I had to watch it and it was ""love at first sight"".Bill was amazing as Matt Stone.He played him so well that you can think that he actually was the character.<>In an interesting and offbeat casting choice, Ole Captain Kirk really gives it all he's got as a totally round-the-bend murdering gigolo in this odd little horror gem from the mid-1970's. Infrequently cast as villains, William Shatner shows how adept he is here at playing them, and sinks his formidable teeth into the role, tossing all subtlety to the wind with complete and utter unfetterd abandon. Also featuring mammoth Harold Sakata (""Oddjob"", the lethal bowler-tossing henchman from ""Goldfinger""-) as one of Shatner's several unlucky victims. Fantastic and trashily-fun.<>It was fun to see Shatner playing the bad guy for once.  This movie is actually more funny than scary, but I really enjoyed it.<>I can't believe this Shatner classic escaped my notice before now, but it's right up there among his trashtastic 70s ouevre of crap along with The Devil's Rain and Kingdom Of The Spiders. Whenever he got an ""impulse,"" my Shatometer pretty much exploded. Must see!<>The best of the Shatner shlockies. Watch this movie right now.  Right. Now.<>This is so bad that it's good.  I loved how the beginning and end fit so well.  Shatner is fabulous in this movie, as a real scoundrel and maniac!

Not scary like The Shining... it's scary like Requiem For a Dream.  The movie tested the limits of my patience re a mentally ill kid.  To see what he does re his mom is beyond cringe.  You want to physically restrain him.  And it's not told in a linear fashion, so you get a bit confused as the subplots seem to flow as 1 very long event.  The acting by Leo Bill is by far the best performance I've ever seen from an actor.  His portrayal of a mentally ill kid was jaw dropping.  Some say this is just a drama... it's absolute not.  It feels like a horror movie.  And it's great.<>I was very intrigued by this movie, but after actually watching it really does not live up to the praise. It is not terrible, for example, the acting is fine and at least the portrayal of a mentally unsound person is not completely butchered. The cinematography works well and can convey some important aspects of the scene for the viewer. I enjoyed the movie for the first half, but this film soon deflates of all suspense. It delves into some dream-like sequences, but these just come off as pretentious.

Scott, Gene Kauer, Dimetri Fermo, Michael Golden, Sean MacDonald, James Roy","Many of the segments have lost their ability to shock, or can easily be recognized as fake by today's more media-savvy audience. Interesting as a curious bit of film history, but nothing more.<>Without the carrot of controversy to draw in viewers, Faces of Death would have only the stick of unconvincing faux-documentary footage.<>Sleazy little relic of a movie. Rather fine DVD release that demystifies the whole thing.<>As a curiosity piece, Faces of Death is well worth a look, especially if you've not seen it in a very long time. As for its place in horror cinema history, well, that remains to be seen.<><>Crude, tasteless exploitation footage. Filmed carnage. Be ashamed to watch this garbage.<>An inexcusable violation of human codes of decency.<><><>Consistently awful<>","Clearly and intentionally not made for a wide audience, this documentary can provide a fulfilling insight on such an uncomfortable subject. That is if you can stomach the real footage. Much of the fake footage has since become outdated 40 years later, and range from somewhat convincing to laughable to clearly fake. However, 60% of the film is comprised of Very Real Death. Many were used a bit tastelessly, like the cyclist footage, but many were also handled very analytically and with some degree of severity, like the Holocaust footage or PSA Flight 182 Crash.

It was exactly what I expected, but also not what I expected at all. I only recommend it to people who know exactly what they're in for, because again, this is Not for everyone.<>This is the most iconic mondo, it has a hidden theme to be grateful about life while you still have it, most of it is fake and the effects are outdated.  It managed to gross 35 million still in the box office and my father snuck into it<>I've discussed the video store of my youth often, but no movie in Prime Time Video inspired such dread as Faces of Death, its gigantic clamshell package covered with a note scrawled in sharpie: YOU MUST BE 18 TO RENT.

This feels like a movie made from VHS, as where were people going to see this in 1978?

Written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (using the name Alan Black for the screenplay and Conan LeCilaire for directing, as well as Johnny Getyerkokov for second unit and appearing with no screen name for his role as the leader of the cannibal cult), this film made $35 million at the box office, despite being outlawed in the UK and made a video nasty. It was not banned in forty countries, no matter what the box art may scream at you, and it really doesn't contain all that much real death either.

Try telling that to the kids in my hometown in the mid-80s.

They believed that pathologist Francis B. Gröss — actually portrayed by Michael Carr — was a real doctor who was using video to explore the phenomena of death itself. They spoke breathlessly of the moments in this movie and it was another torture test film, one people bragged about surviving.

As this was a non-union film, there weren't many credits, so it could have seemed real. But today, so many people have come forward discussing how they were involved in the movie. Estimates are that 40% of the film is fake, but the death scene of the female cyclist is real and the alligator scene also shows up in Naked and Cruel.

In today's world, we have the internet, which has non-stop access to the kind of footage that Faces of Death could only dream of having access to getting. As such, we are numb to the kind of panic and worry that one would have with this movie staring back at them from the shelves of a mom and pop video store.

Is it any wonder that Legendary is rebooting this film series but making it friendlier? Here's the logline for the film: ""A female moderator of a YouTube-like website whose job is to weed out offensive and violent content and who herself is recovering from a serious trauma, who stumbles across a group that is re-creating the murders from the original film. But in the story primed for the digital age of online misinformation, the question is: Are the murders real or fake?""

Nobody is going to have nightmares about that movie.<>Wow, the cheesy music and unfair comparisons of cultural barbarism was bearable to catch some snuff, but the last ten minutes easily could have been cut and destroyed the credibility of some of the footage of death in this ""documentary"". The 70's sure looked like a wild time.

If they'd simply trimmed out the fake stuff and provided more details on what was real it might have been of some value. I love stories of the gruesome and macabre, and that's what Faces Of Death should have been, with some fascinating science thrown in. Instead the film diminishes its own quality by showing shoddily filmed, horribly edited segments of staged violence and death and trying to pass them off as real.

[Full review in Spanish]<>For our era, Rudd is a perfect everyman. I enjoyed Segel's antics, but liked Rashida Jones even more. A few leading roles and she would be the Doris Day of a new age.<>Rudd and Segal's onscreen chemistry is palpable, and combined with some fantastic bit-players, the film delivers easy, if somewhat puerile laughs.<>That movies from this brand will have ""heart"" is now a given, but the variety Rudd provides here is singular.<>[T]his unpretentious crowd-pleaser is still punchy enough to send packed theaters reeling in riotous laughter.<>One of the better recent 'buddy comedies' and one if you're in the mood to laugh, you definitely won't regret showing a little love.<>Rudd and Segel share genuine chemistry and the early scenes in which their bromance blossoms are tinged with recognisable humour; the dumb nicknames; the inexplicable use of silly voices; the embarrassingly out-dated 'man slang'.<>If Rudd steals the show, Segel deserves props for downplaying Sydney's regressiveness.<>It's hard not to like this witty, well-made celebration of friendship in which two very different guys come to know and appreciate each other.<>For both men though, it's the sincerity lurking just beneath the bravado which sets the film apart from the abrasive comedy it might have been.<>At the end of the day it is a pretty formulaic bromantic comedy, and the little bit of a twist it has can't hide that fact. But it's done really, really well and that counts for a lot.<>The film is a microcosm of us all, guys - raucous, juvenile and puerile on the outside, but tender, sweet and vulnerable in our hearts.<>Pays respect to the crucial role male bonding plays in adulthood...<>We all know where the film is heading, but that's hardly the point. Rudd and Segel are such entertaining guides you're willing to follow them anywhere.<>Thanks to the incredible chemistry of its two leads, I Love You, Man stands as one of the best buddy comedies since Swingers.<>Feel the man love with I Love You, Man, a constantly entertaining comedy about marriage, love, and friendship which is aimed towards adults.","LOL, the funniest 1.75 hours that changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>This is quickly becoming my favourite comedy of all time.   Paul Rudd is exceedingly likeable as a guy getting married but realizes he has no close guy friends.  Enter Jason Segal a dude's dude who befriends him.  Filled with hilarious situations and perfect performances from not only the leads but the entire cast.  JK Simmonds, Andy Samburg, Rashida Jones, Jon Favreau and Lou Ferrigno, among many others are featured.  There are very few movies that put a smile on my face from beginning to end and this is one of them.  Love this movie.<>Pretty funny and wholesome. Worth the watch<>75/100 - comfort food, a feel good film. this movie is funny, charming, and the awkward moments do a great job of pointing out our flaws. they approached the topic of male relationships well and its a good laugh, worth the watch.<>Yes, this is another ""bromance."" Yes, it hews pretty close to the romantic comedy formula. Yes, it's raunchy and a little rude. But this comedy still comes out a winner thanks to a winning cast, brisk pacing, and some genuine belly laughs. Paul Rudd and Jason Segel ('Knocked Up' and 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' co-stars) have great chemistry and their rapport is hilarious. Rudd tones down his usually snarky demeanor and finds his inner geek to bring a goofy charm to his character. Segel effortlessly pulls off his character's shaggy, care-free hipness. But director John Hamburg doesn't let them hog all the laughs. He peoples his supporting cast with funny actors--J.K. Simmons, Jane Curtain, Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau, Joe Lo Truglio, Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg, Thomas Lennon, Sarah Burns. Even Lou Ferrigno, in an extended cameo, scores. Hamburg also keeps this a light, breezy affair. The players pop in, land their laughs, the energy rarely winds down, and things zip along nicely. The film also is rather observed in male friendship and the comedy here isn't broad or silly. It's funny on a human, realistic level, and the laughs are all the bigger and more genuine because they flirt with the truth. This is no masterpiece, but it's a breezy, sweet, light-hearted, and funny comedy that makes you feel good. And that's what a good comedy is supposed to do<>A fun play on the rom com genre, using male friendship as the core focus and the actual romance being more of a side thing. Jason Segal owns his role to the utmost, while Paul Rudd makes a pretty decent stab, particularly while 'slapping the bass', but his character's awkwardness gets a bit tiresome after a while, which is obviously due to actual scripting than Rudd himself. Aside from minor peeve though, it's a pleasant and easily digestible watch, that actually has more depth than I remember when I originally viewed it over a decade ago.<>It's hard to imagine a more Judd Apatow-like movie that Judd Apatow had nothing to do with than I Love You, Man.  Encouraged by his fiance (Rashida Jones), Peter (Paul Rudd), a real estate agent with plenty of acquaintances but no close friends, embarks on a quest to find male companionship, eventually befriending Sydney (Jason Segel), a charming but aimless man-child.  Everything about the movie is likeable, including the likeable three lead actors, the likeable dialogue, and the likeable scenarios.  Heck, even the always likeable Lou Ferrigno shows up.  Despite the fact that the one-joke premise wears a bit thin at times and that there are a few slow spots, I Love You, Man is still…well.…likeable.<>71%. Pretty funny, some good laughs. Threshold for a rewatch is lower for comedies but many other comedies I'd rather rewatch<>""I Love You, Man"" feels dead. Like dead, dead. It's lifeless. Meaningless. No heart, and no joy. The characters are stale, almost wooden, like a carved plank. Their words mean nothing and their actions even less. This is a dramedy but more so just a comedy, and what do you typically get with comedies? Funny dialogue and jokes. But, sadly, those typical comedy traits are completely absent from ""I Love You, Man,"" and it makes the movie all the more insufferable for it. In the end, the movie wastes a fine premise and is dead within 20 minutes. Save yourself some time and don't watch it.

Les violences conjugales, evidemment plus parlantes et explicites, sont particulierement mises en avant : il ne saurait etre question d'eluder de tels drames mais, le documentaire se voulant globalisant, on regrette qu'il se contente de condamner des faits par definition condamnables et neglige d'examiner les causes historiques et psychologiques du patriarcat.

The movie is a collection of interviews with Jean Dominique and his widow and footage of the events that shook this country to the very core. 
Demme did a good job and made the most of the interviews, however he relies too much in the spoken word, and at some points it gets a bit tedious, too much information. I just wish he would display action more prominently to make it more palatable

Oh believe me it was bad, really really bad but more ""Why am I wasting my time on this?""  So I turned it off half way through.  That's how bad it was.  It takes a great deal for me to turn a movie that I really wanted to see off.  But I couldn't take one more minute of it.  I thought I would die of boredom.
    The ONE funny scene was when John Ridd (Clive Owen) is falling down a waterfall and at the bottom when he is falling into the pool of water it shows a full frontal view of...not Clive...but the 40 something stuntman who looks nothing like him.  You'll see this again when John falls off his horse.  
     I thought I could hold out through the movie because of Sean Bean (Carver Doone).  I really do love him but the mullet wasn't doing anything for me.  I think that if Clive Owens' acting had been a little better i would also have been able to hold out but he was horrible.  I don't think his facial expression changed once throughout.

I loved this movie.<>""Grandma"" tackles social issues with utter frankness, humor, and intelligence.<>It mostly feels as if it has been thrown together over a weekend (both the writing and the direction). But the script crackles and spits.<>Sweet, funny and delightfully acerbic, watching actress Lily Tomlin do her best work since earning an Oscar nom for 1976's Nashville is monumental in itself.<>A great role for a truly great talent, who just happens to be in her 70s. The movie is just under 90 minutes, but Tomlin delivers in that short time. Her wise-cracking one-liners are tempered by a real sense of loss and vulnerability.<>Written and directed by Paul Weitz, Grandma is wickedly funny, emotionally intelligent and also very brave.<>... Grandma is overall a funny, thoughtful, occasionally sad film about several generations of women in a family trying to deal with one another, anchored by Lily Tomlin's fantastic performance.<>It's a modest film that more than pays off its investment. (Among those who an take credit is Andrew Miano, one of the film's producers and a native Buffalonian.)<>You realize you're watching a movie-finally!-about a teenager who has an abortion and turns out fine, and it couldn't seem more honest.<>[Grandma] is an entirely unimaginatively directed melange of indie aesthetic cliches.","One of the worse movies I've seen in all my born days...<>I really enjoyed this movie.  Loved Julia Garner.   Sam Elliot was really great.<>This is labeled as a drama/comedy. There was very little comedy and most of it was related to the violence. This was a very sad and depressing story that ended even more sad than I was hoping.<>Grandma is an amazingly charming movie due mostly in part to the STRONG Lily Tomlin and Julia Garner, but there's also so much to glean from this movie. It is honest about self doubt, broken relationships, and the harboring pain that results from these. It also adeptly shines light on the things that bring us through the muck of life. A great dramedy most often makes me feel sad and hopeful - Grandma does both spectacularly.<>This one really does scream 'tv movie'. It has all those missing elements, plus what really seem like built in commercial break points, and the lazy, cliched writing. There are a few good moments, along with some really bad ones. The little girl punch scene and the walking erection subhuman donor the trampy granddaughter made a baby with scene are pretty awful. 
Sam Elliott is ok, in that Sam Elliott way. He's never really bad, but that voice goes along way, esp. with that face. He can be like someone millions of us know in a seemingly effortless way. 
Marcia Gay Harden is good at being that person I've seen too many times, but is very real. Tomlin could've tried harder, to be honest. Judy Greer was good casting. 2.6 stars<>I'm shaky on the premise. I don't like the idea of abortion. But the fact that a man could write such incredible dialog about what it's like for 3 women (and 3 generations) to experience this situation is absolutely astounding. Lily Tomlin has never been better. All of the performances are fantastic. It's one of the most effective and real films I've ever seen.<>Not for me, too saccharine for my taste, but I can't deny the fabulous performances by the entire cast. It's all-star people doing 5-star work, including the relative newcomer from Ozark (Julia Garner). Marcia Gaye Harden steals scenes like always and Lily Tomlin is...well, a national treasure. Then there's bits by Judy Greer, Laverne Cox, and Sam Eliot, all fantastic.  So, bear in mind I found just slightly edgier than a Hallmark movie, but the cast is so good I can't give it fewer than 5.<>Solid actor work and more<>Just when I thought Lily Tomlin and Julia Gardner could do no wrong. I was shocked at how stiff and forced the acting was throughout, except for Sam Elliot, who seems to turn the whole film around in a more honest and gripping direction. Contrived narrative, though important topic, handled much more sensitively and cogently elsewhere<>The story does not quite live up to the performances but the two leads are fantastic and well matched making of the most of their material.","Andrew Miano, Paul Weitz, Paris Kasidokostas Latsis, Terry Dougas","Aug 21, 2015 limited",$7.0M,Sony Pictures Classics,R (Some Drug Use|Language),,,

The characters are nice the shows are positive and the acting is off the scale of the late stuff from America. And great leads like Ahmed Sylla what a smile!
You can watch another murder in Los Angeles.

Guess the murder thing is just America? Another serial killer cool!
While other countries shows tell up beat stories of life and love and stepping out of your comfort zone we Americans kill and do Red #15 and comic book characters. 
There are real heroes stories from around the world, you can't make up reality. 

Even the scarry movies are better - Train to Bussan, Into the Night, To the Lake.<>Boy loves girl. Girl secretly loves boy.  Boy climbs Mount Everest to prove his love.  Girl lets him.  That's the premise of The Climb, a very likeable story of unrequited love.  Loosely based on a true story (apparently the names have been changed, the nationality of the climber has been changed, as has the motivation for climbing Everest), you will not be able to help yourself from cheering for the lovestruck protagonist, despite the fact that the whole premise seems implausible.  The performances are fine, the cinematography is beautiful, the story is captivating, and, despite all of this, you will probably hate yourself for liking it when the final credits roll.<>The Climb is loosely (very) inspired by Dendoune's 
unbelievable feat. This underdog tale doesn't take itself too seriously, with likeable and funny leads. Everest is a star in itself with the sweeping backdrops. Clamber aboard.<>Very quirky tale of male friendship that leaves the female actors pretty much in the wings. The characters were also unlikeable.<>This film is about the friendship between two guys over a number of years. It starts out really bad but eventually gets better... still the two central guys are so obnoxious that it is sometimes a chore to watch them.<>This U.S. indie film begins life as a one-take short film about two friends cycling in the French countryside when one makes a surprising confession to the other. Expanding this into a feature length, co-writers and co-stars Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, with the former also directing, accomplish something both laugh-out-loud funny and emotionally rewarding, charting the various stages of their friendship through family and fiancées. With roles literally tailor made for themselves by themselves, they certainly have the characters' look and expressions down pat and the duo has a genuine chemistry between them. If the script is an uncynical yet hilarious and heartfelt look at a bromance between two guys, the production and direction is a tour de force showcase of what diligent preparations and perfectly devised choreography can achieve. Taking a cue from the original short, the film is divided into chapters and each chapter is shot seemingly (as I am sure there are some cheating going on but it is done so seamlessly it's almost churlish to spoil the magic here by noting it) in extended one-takes which give the film an exciting, almost documentary, real time feel to it. Whether it is a continuous pan along the windows of a house watching everyone enjoying a Christmas party or a conversation on a frozen lake that ends up somewhere rather more distressing, the wandering camerawork is playful and imaginatively executed, and more than meet the challenges they have set themselves up for.

Hooker and Gondorff set about implementing an elaborate scheme, one so crafty that Lonnegan won't even know he's been swindled.

You can sit back and enjoy their discomfiture. <>Pure popcorn like this is hardly worthy of serious analysis... Fortunately, the stars have not lost their charm and authority. <>Sheer, joyful entertainment. It's a fun picture. Not a comedy, although it's filled with witty lines and laugh-provoking situations. The Sting is a perfect vehicle on which to forget 1973, a year which hasn't given us many laughs.<>It's a joy to look at and has that rarest of present-day ingredients, Hill's hallmark -- taste. What glitters here is pure movie gold. <>There is just no way not to love this movie. <>The sort of film about which old-timers say ""They don't make 'em like that anymore."" It's the sort that is content to be entertaining (no mean feat in itself) and not determined to be the biggest, bloodiest, sexiest, fastest film making the rounds. <>Purists might say with justice that a great deal of the complicated plot is preposterous. But it matters very little, since the film is filled with charm, not the least of which is Scott Joplin's lively ragtime score.<>It is ingeniously done. Everyone displays a stylish sense of fun, and the film sends you away feeling satisfied to an extent that too few films do.<>A ""movie"" movie that has obviously been made with loving care each and every step of the way.<>For sheer pleasure, light humor and victory for the good guys, The Sting wins hands down. It's one of those rare afternoons at the movies that remind you what movies are all about.<>These people simply seem to be able to mesh like parts of a machine, reacting smoothly and with an understated humor that propels the viewer effortlessly along.<>One pleasure quickly giving way to the next, The Sting is the sort of film you once expected when Hollywood was known as Tinsel Town. An entertainment that lights up the sky with laughter.<>It is glossy, self-conscious, theatrically forced. And, in company with its material, it comes off false. Fun but false. <>Hill's stylish, old-fashioned film, complete with Norman Rockwell- style sketches which open up into well-detailed scenes of Chicago in the good-bad old days, is always pleasant and absorbing.<>It's a pleasure being conned by an artist like Hill.<>[The Sting] is an unalloyed delight, the kind of pure entertainment film that's all the more welcome for having become such a rarity. What's more, it's a triumph of quality Hollywood craftsmanship.<>Our interest is directed less to the people we meet than to the step-by-step construction of the trap, a process which exerts neither less nor more fascination than a book on how to cheat at cards. <>You may find yourself, as you leave the theater, still a little confused as to exactly what happened. The point is, though, that you will have had a simply marvelous time -- as obviously did Newman and Redford while making the picture. ","I usually have trouble sitting through long movies but this film did a great job of keeping my attention with a good story with many twists and turns.<>An All Time Classic. Every core element of this is phenomenal but it takes time to build up but it does so at a perfect pacing. This is filled with wit, twists, charm, and a memorable soundtrack to boot. Everyone should give this a watch at least once. Simple As That.<>There was a really great sense of style and the twists and conning were great. It got a few laughs from friends as well at several points. Really fun movie.<>this movie is one of my favourites, i saw with my dad, and i was lucky he didn't spoiler me anything, because it is so unpredictable. and it has amazing plot twists<>I'm sure this movie still holds up as a great one because it's perfect.  Everything ties together and there are no plot holes.  You have to wait for some events to tie together but they always do.  And in the most fun and well executed way by the best actors !!  A great movie.<>Truly entertaining classic. Better watch with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. They won here.<>Coming from modern heist movies, was somewhat satisfying. The actors did their job and the story was on point up to the obvious plot twist—nonetheless good reference material for fans of the genre.<>It's an excellent motion picture, The Sting, 1973...

With a script well done by David S. Ward, director, George Roy Hill also a famous film maker of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969 starring by same characters, Paul Newman and Robert Redford...<>Old-style yet universally exciting.

With the beginning scene, the viewer is immediately teleported into the world of the two confidence men and presented with the central themes of the movie: theft, dishonesty and fraud. No one can be trusted, yet everyone is a relatable, fun and exquisitely human character. The pace is fast and the events are constantly exciting, Still, while the viewer is informed of the shady nature of the protagonists, the series of events does not get needlessly intricate and resolves without the need for a deus ex machina.

The truly iconic soundtrack by Scott Joplin, together with the 1930-style introduction of the characters, manages to evoke the atmosphere of Great Depression America. Nevertheless, while various aspects clearly set the events in a precise time and place, the key elements that make it interesting (from the dishonesty to the exciting plot twists) can be appreciated today as well as in the 1970s.<>Really loved this.

It is able to find beauty in this Long Island community while still remaining clear-eyed and thoughtful.<>The Last Race feels like the work of someone who wanted to make a documentary but had no clue what story he wanted to tell.<>This verite-style documentary doesn't pass judgment, instead making a powerful statement about the price of progress by following the stories of track owners, drivers, and fans who would miss it if it's gone.<>A gallery of vivid, socially conscious photography, The Last Race owes much of its artful strength to the filmmaker's resistance to being prescriptive about his unambiguous socio-economic message.<>""We don't look good, but we like to go fast,"" one driver says, summing it all up, a fitting tribute to a proud but imperiled subculture and the surprising film that wants to ensure it is not forgotten.<>Auto racing is noisy and not great for the environment.

This looked more like a college film project than a feature documentary.  It's stretched and I do mean stretched to 75 minutes.  I'm not sure if the filmmaker was looking at his subjects with reverence or disdain.  There are instances of his making people who were interviewed look foolish.  Why? Great question.  The more I think about this the more it annoys me so wrap this.  Final Score: 5.3/10<>Gives a deep look into what racing is all about and who has your trust. The film could have been longer to give more depth to the story. <>This movie was a very insightful movie of the whole racing culture. If anyone wants to get into the whole racing culture, and needs a few insights of how the culture operates and socializes, this movie is definitely able to provide that for you. 
The best thing about this movie was the perspectives provided in the movie. The perspectives were from different sides of the community. They had the orator, the computers, the collectors, and others. it was very ideal, because of the perspectives and how these people contribute to the entire culture.<>A great documentary about a racetrack on Long Island that's a holdout in a world of encroaching development and lessening interest in cars.","Michael Dweck, Gregory Kershaw","Nov 16, 2018 limited",$10.8K,Magnolia Pictures,,,,

(1988) Bat 21
WAR

 Story based from an actual person by the name of William C. Anderson from his own book of the very same name, who not only provided the screenplay but was also credited as a consultant.  Takes place during the Vietnam War, with 'weapons countermeasures expert' Lieutenant Colonel Iceal ""Ham"" Hambleton(Gene Hackman) becoming stranded in the jungle after the plane he was in was shot down who appears to be the only survivor equipped with him is a walkie-talkie. And it is up to Captain Bartholomew Clark (Danny Glover) flying a ""Cessma 337 Skylander"" to keep him from either getting captured for a possible information leak or killed.   And to keep each of their actual identities a secret, they each have to communicate with each other by using codenames- ""Bat 21"" as the movie is called is Hambleton's code name with Clark's code name is called ""Bird dog"".  The scenes between Hackman and Glover are genuinely worth watching since both are veteran actors, but the rhythm in terms of the story structure itself by producers and anybody else who also wanted their two-cents in is convoluted since viewers never find out how the Vietnamese army ever find out that ""Bat 21"" is really a 'weapons countermeasures expert'!  And the other thing that was very troubling was near the end when the movie was trying to convince viewers that the village was isolated, and it wasn't.  That entire scene was dumb and was obviously there because producers wanted it to be there to liven the experience since they didn't think that to have two great actors correspond to one another was entertaining enough.

He also befriends a fellow prisoner named Batise, they both make an exchange to help one another escape 
It isn't until later they start to understand Morgan's just a man and begins to assimilate into their culture 
Not only that but he falls in love with a female member of the tribe, a matriarchy of sorts
Morgan is determined to be a chief which of course leads to a very infamous ritual scene where he must scar his body as well as be accustomed to the pain for the rite of passage 
Morgan also wants little to do with his British aristocratic ways after learning so much with the indigenous peoples even facing a warring tribe shifts his views entirely if these people are to to continue

a different kind of Western without the usual gunfights, bar scenes, or cookie cutter bad guys you're used to seeing plus there's good looking at the human condition as well as going on a spiritual journey of your own
the viewer definitely grows to like this tribe as much as Morgan because they just want to be understood and show they have a place to belong among other men

Only when he proves his worth does he earn his ""freedom"".  The sun sacrifice was the most interesting aspect. But this is presented in a realistic way without subtitles. It is a little harsh, but still interesting.<>This movie is one of the very best  I've ever seen.<>I just saw this film, now 44 years after it's premiere.  Perhaps for its time, it was a unique enough story: the good, smart and refined white man is attacked by brutish Indians. Over time, he overcomes the suffering at the hands of the noble savages and because of his bravery is accepted as a member of the tribe. Part of that bravery is enduring the pain of being pierced through the skin over his pectorals and being lifted up in some type of large lodge which would have been more suitable to the taste of the Wichitas than to the Sioux. Indeed, some Lakota is spoken, but the constant imploring of ""Wakantanka"" instead of to ""Tunkashila"" is not quite right.  The headdresses are fancifully imagined and the gesticulations and grunts do not add to any authenticity.  On a positive note, I thought Dame Judith Anderson's acting as the mother was actually quite good and, at times, humorous. Why the Shoshone were depicted as the enemy is really beyond me, but then what does real history have to do with this film?  As for the lauded sundance in the film, it is a holy, sacred and spiritual ritual - indeed, the most holy of the seven Lakota rites. I would venture to say that using the sundance in this way in order to accept a person into the tribe because of his or her ability to withstand pain is utter nonsense.  The ""hunka"" ceremony is the L/N/Dakota ritual for adoption.  The sundance is about personal sacrifice for one's people and oneself.  I find this rendering of the ceremony very belittling and it shows that the writers obviously didn't care enough about the Sioux (Lakota/Nakota/Dakota) people to  actually find out what it is all about.<>Great story, fantastic stunts, super violent.<>My favorite of all Richard Harris movies.

The actors/actresses seemed well chosen for their parts. It was filmed well. The setting was perfect. It was atmospheric.   I can't say it was a scare fest, but it didn't seem to be meant to be one, and still I was creeped out by several scenes. I kind of wished it had been drawn out more, made into an even longer film.  Maybe I'm tired of the blood and guts, cheap scare, slasher type films so this really appealed to me because it really wasn't one overall?  Who knows.  It's definitely gothic and I felt that and appreciated it.   There was nothing poorly made about this, not the filming, not the setting, not the acting, not the score, not the script, not even the story.  If people didn't like that it was about teenage girls and set in an all girl boarding school, then they shouldn't have set down and watched it in the first place. It's not like they hid that fact in the blurb about the movie.  Anyway, in a setting of an all teenage girls boarding school, you're liable to come across issues that affect teenage girls.

Julie has recently remarried the man of her dreams after the tragic death of her husband.

""He nearly killed us both; but he seemed so sorry, so desperately sorry.""

Andrew Stone, director of Song of Norway, Hi Diddle Diddle, The Last Voyage, The Great Waltz, Ring of Fire, The Steel Trap, and Say It in French, delivers Julie.  The storyline for this picture is just okay and not overly dramatic.  I felt the film was fairly average for the most part but turns slightly ridiculous towards the end.  The acting was solid and the cast includes Doris Day, Jack Kelly, Ann Robinson, Louis Jourdan, Barry Sullivan, and Jack Kruschen. 

""I was in no mood for golf; after a few holes, I'd had it.""

I recorded this off Turner Classic Movies (TCM) this past Halloween season and was excited to see a Doris Day picture.  This, unfortunately, was very mediocre and could have been better.  I thought the final plane sequence was good until she ultimately had to fly the plane (ridiculous).  Overall, this is below average and not really worth your time.

[Full Review in Spanish]<><>,"The Wild Party is an early offering from the team of James Ivory (director) and Ismael Merchant (producer) and offers all of the glossy production details one has come to expect from the pair.  Unfortunately, once all of the glitter is wiped away, the movie is pretty weak.  The premise is interesting – a silent film star (James Coco), trying to revive his career as talkies sweep the industry, hosts a party with his wife (Raquel Welch) to introduce his latest film.  The dialogue is trite, the acting is wooden, many scenes drag on far too long (Welch singing Singapore Sally, for example), and the character narrating the events via poetry is wildly annoying.<>Sometimes its apparent why a movie was made, whether or not it hit its intended mark. A Michael Bay film (pick one, any one) may not even flirt with the idea of high art, but at least you know what to except walking into it. He delivers what any reasonable person might expect from the twentieth installment of giant robots pummeling each other silhouetted against the American flag.

With some other films, that isnt always the case. You can stare at the screen for hours, scratching your head and wondering what the point is. The questions are the same. Who is this for? What were these filmmakers trying to do? Who at the studio decided this was exactly what they were looking for, gave it a big stamp of approval, and shoved it into the world? Those stories, it turns out, can be much more interesting than those of the gold standards we hold up as models of cinema.

The making of The Wild Party (1975) is a story of the little indie studio that could, or rather the little grindhouse mill that could. American International Pictures carved a little niche for themselves by churning out B-movie fare guaranteed to turn a profit overseas. It wasnt big money, but it was enough to keep their little movie mill chugging along. But company head Samuel Z. Arkoff wasnt content with hamster wheel business model. He decided it was time for AIP to start contending with the big dogs. This the seed for The Wild Party was planted.

Directed by then-unknown James Ivory (he had only made art films in India until then) and starring the in vogue Raquel Welch, The Wild Party was supposed to be AIPs ticket to award season glamor and deep pockets. They adapted the scandalous Prohibition-era poem by Joseph March of the same name and set off to make what is essentially a sexploitation film set at the advent of talkies. Except that's not exactly what makes it to the screen.

The Wild Party, as it finally manifested, is a pedantic, meandering mess of a film that takes a couple of good ideas and sends them adrift in a sea of clutter. We begin with silent film star Jolly Grimm (James Coco), attempting to sell his latest mute comedy to his former bankrollers. But no one is interested now that sound has married picture. Had the film stayed focused on Jollys spiral into irrelevance, it would have been a profound character study. Instead, it wanders into overlong stretches with side-characters that often contribute nothing except minutes to the runtime. You almost get the feeling that Ivory wanted to hew close to the contemplative art films that he was used to, but theres not enough of that for this to be avante garde. Its just slow and mean-spirited.

By the time the story devolves into sexual abandon and violence, theres almost nothing to care about anymore. The scenes are so long and so devoid of tension that when blood spills, theres nothing for the audience to do but shrug and toss their popcorn cartons on the way out. AIP wanted to make a film that pushed the boundaries of decency (like their made-for-Russia exports), but seemed to get cold feet when cutting it together. Its a toothless film that wants to embrace its raunch but blushes and turns away at the last minute.

There are far worse mid-70s stumbles to feast upon than The Wild Party and far more spectacular flops. The lesson here is that losing focus and conviction can doom a film to the forgotten land of bland monotony. Oh, and dont hire Raquel Welch. I hear shes a nightmare to work with. 4.1/10<>Good cinematography in the 70's looks better than almost anything made now. That is the main reason to recommend the Wild Party- the clear, vivid colors of 1975 really held my interest. Otherwise, this film is a really odd curio. Where else can you find James Coco and Perry King vying for the affections of Raquel Welch all mixed in with period musical set pieces?<>At this ""Wild Party"" there's sex, alcohol and murder.  James Coco plays an aging Hollywood star in the 1920s who gives the party so everyone can see his new picture.  Problem is no one really cares about this picture, except for mild applause by a few sycophants.  Seems the public wants talkies and action pictures.  Poor guy!  His girll Queenie (played by beautiful Raquel Welch) goes off with the stud (chiseled Perry King).  What's he gonna do?

The problem is the movie is a combination of comedy, musical, and drama.  The comedy is light, there's no mystery in the drama, and the musical numbers are the most memorable thing about this movie.  Ivory is an intellectual director so is not really suited to a movie hat is visceral, the art direction, costume designs, and old mansion  are the best elements. A misfire though I found some parts worth watching.",Ismail Merchant,,,,R,,,

Night Shyamalan's movies, as he blows their minds with his mysterious masterpieces. In The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan opens the movie with Dr. Malcolm, a therapist, celebrating his work with his wife. During the celebration party, an intruder breaks into the house and accuses Dr. Malcolm of failing to treat him; eventually, he shoots him and ends his own life. The following fall, Malcolm observes a boy named Cole. The journey starts with Malcolm trying to approach Cole to help him in honor of the intruder who killed himself in Malcolm's house. On the other hand, Cole is not performing well in school and has had his mom and teachers see his strange actions, making him feel worse. One day, Cole gets bullied at a birthday party and thrown in a locked room in a horrific scene ending in the hospital. On the other side, Malcolm feels his wife is ignoring him and tries to get closer to her but gets no opportunity as if he is not there. In the hospital, Cole confesses his condition to Dr. Malcolm, which was the plot twist in the movie. After that, Malcolm finds a way to help Cole, which they start applying. Finally, Cole confesses his condition to his mother in an emotional scene, and Shyamalan shocks the audience by showing a scene explaining Dr. Malcolm's case. 
   As the movie shocks the audience with its theme and events, it also carries hidden messages. Shyamalan has had his signature on many paranormality-themed movies; Signs, The Visit, and The Sixth Sense. In this movie, he mastered the art of paranormality, mystery, and thrill. Through his two main characters and focusing on their lives, Shyamalan succeeds in planting a value in them in the audience's minds. The steady and perfect development in their stories makes the audience interact more with them. Smartly, Shyamalan deceives the audience
into seeing and believing what he wants. Scott Essman, a writer-producer, comments on the movie that the audience rewatched the movie many times because they could not believe how fooled and deceived by the director they were; he made them think the story is about one character while it is all about the other one. Throughout the movie, the director delivers many messages that talk about the concept of life and death. He shows how some people take their lives for granted and sheds light on the importance of not giving up. Cole's story shows the
importance of appreciating life, where people should focus more on what they have than what they do not. People should be grateful for everything and live truthfully before it is late. Through Malcolm's story, the audience learns not to give up and always look after the mistakes they make to never fall into them again. Moreover, when people face situations where they are mistaken, they should be brave the next time they face a similar one and be prepared to solve the problem, not escape it, just like Malcolm did.
   The Sixth Sense is a movie that will forever be in the minds of its audience due to the impact that it could leave, yet it had some flaws in the details of some of its scenes. As one of the audience, I see no sense in some scenes. When Cole's mother was trying to help him, people were looking at her with no effort of going and getting the keys to the door. Such flaws were repeated a couple of times in the movie. It also could have been better if the director focused on having more first-point-of-view scenes because that could add more tension and thrill to the
movie. Nevertheless, I still see The Sixth Sense as a masterpiece that people should have on their to-watch lists because of its plot line, plot twists, and outcomes. I have watched it more than five times and still see new things I never saw before. So, it is a 5/5<>The best thriller in the history of cinema, a masterpiece.<>One of the best thrillers ever!<>Great movie and well acted, Toni Collette is amazing.

Fywell and Welch decided that Henry James was too subtle and nuanced, apparently, and decided instead to take the route of bludgeoning their audience over the head with sexual repression and male dominance heirarchy instead of warped human psychology as the motive.  And, to be honest, the choices of ""scare tactics"" were so heavy handed, so trite and cliched as to be laughable.  For instance, Quint is a monumental pervert of sex and violence, the children talk in ""monster voices"" when possessed by Quint and Jessel; overdubbed whispers and ""ghostly"" sounds abound; a scary shadow moves in front of the camera; Master Miles smiles ""evilly"" at the camera after doing a bad deed; when governess Ann is put in the paddy wagon after leaving the mental hospital, one of the guards suddenly morphs into Quint, much to the astonishment of Dr. Fisher (Stevens).

So far as I can tell, the difference between the two options Rotten Tomatoes gives me for where to enter this is whether I'm writing about the theatrical release or the DVD.  There also seems to be a third, and I haven't looked to see if it's the same movie yet again.  I'm putting this under the entry for the theatrical release even though I haven't seen a true IMAX theatrical release since the early '90s.  This is because I don't think there's any difference among them, so that's the date all entries should be under.  I'm aware that I'm asking too much to expect Rotten Tomatoes to get their act together on this one.  Why should they start with this?  But as usual, I thought I'd point out that they have screwed up and explain why I made the choice I did.  So here we are.

Obviously, there isn't much in the way of footage from most of Mark Twain's life.  As it happens, I've just gotten access to some of it; there's a public domain movie channel for the Roku, and among other things, it's got footage of the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.  But you're not exactly going to get Mark Twain's boyhood in Hannibal on film, is what I'm saying.  Instead, what we have here is a combination of pictures and reenacting.  A Fourth of July parade in modern-day Hannibal, which passes right by the large statue of Tom and Huck.  Those reliable friends of filmmakers everywhere, Civil War reenactors.  The famous photo of Mark Twain on his porch in a rocking chair, a small and blurred kitten by his feet.  And over it all, the slow, soothing voice of Anne Bancroft telling us the life story of one Samuel Clemens, as well as what the country was like as he grew up in it.

The movie uses considerably fewer of the famous Twain quotes, choosing to leave out ""those unaccountable freaks"" and ""this will sell us another five thousand copies for sure.""  Instead, there are rather lengthy passages about his Civil War experiences, his travel abroad, and his hopes of fame and fortune from gold mining.  Let's face it.  Anyone could tell us that he was the first person to submit a manuscript which had been typed.  ([i]Life on the Mississippi[/i], which he had in fact handwritten first and which was typed by someone else.)  However, the film chooses instead to go with the Twain who was so determined not to invest in another dang fool gadget that he missed out in becoming partners with a young man by the name of Alexander Graham Bell.

Which, I have to tell you, is probably apocryphal.  I can't say for sure, but Alexander Graham Bell wasn't a nobody.  He could, after all, afford the lawyers he ended up needing for the patent disputes.  But that's the thing about Mark Twain.  He invented himself.  Mark Twain and Samuel Clemens might be said to be two different people.  However, I can forgive him this when I can't forgive William Faulkner, because Mark Twain never wanted you to take him seriously.  Why should you?  He didn't.  The stories he told about his own life were pretty firmly tongue-in-cheek, and he knew you knew that.  Think, possibly, about a favourite uncle, one whose delight is in stringing a story out for as long as possible before you realize he's making the whole thing up.  I wouldn't exactly say the film captured that Mark Twain, but it definitely hinted at it.

The problem is that Mark Twain today is as much legend as man.  I'd imagine that increasingly few people actually read his books; I must confess I haven't read a lot of them myself.  People know of Tom and Huck, but I don't think they really know them.  And even if people have read the books, I don't think they necessarily think about the fact that, unlike Tom and Huck, Sam Clemens grew up.  As it happens, the first piece of Twain I ever read was a letter he wrote to his youngest daughter, Susie, claiming to be a letter from Santa Claus.  This means that I've spent most of my life thinking of him as a grown-up with children.  The movie includes the quote about how, in his days as a Confederate officer, Twain was nearly captured by Ulysses S. Grant's men.  Which is funny.  But how many people know that Samuel Clemens then befriended the general and helped the dying man write his memoirs so that the Grant family wouldn't starve?<>I took Jared to see this at the IMAX.

Although the story of T24 is ultimately the most moving part of the film seeing the unguarded footage of wild tigers in a theater made for additional impact. In fact I have never seen such strong footage of tigers in the wild.

The story telling holds your interest. Just when you think the Director Warren Pereira is taking you down a pro-activist path as so many docs do he tactfully pulls you into the POV of the government who declare T24 to be a man-eater.

A great watch for anyone who loves a great story but a must watch for doc lovers and natural history lovers. This is not wall paper like OUR PLANET and PLANET EARTH, this is riveting film-making with backdrop of gorgeous natural history footage.

It will definitely make you see many perspectives, and see a world outside of your own. You can tell that a lot of work and care went into crafting this film. I can't wait until it comes out for digital release! I will definitely be buying it. Well done to everyone that worked on this film!",Warren Pereira,"Jun 10, 2022 limited",,Elevation Pictures,,,,

It's so weird. It's like a quilt. Scraps of video pieced together.<>*SPOILERS* My boyfriend turned this movie on the other night. He told me it was good but sad. To me it looked incredibly cheesy and boring. I'm not into chick flicks or love stories. However,  I gave it a chance but it ended up being exactly as I assumed it would be. I spent the whole time yelling at the characters in frustration. 
The film starts off with Natalie, a teenage girl, who is very focused on tennis practice and getting into a university.  She has a normal social and family life. There isn't much chaos surrounding her. All is good up until she meets this boy named Keith who is her partner in Chemistry class. 
Jesse McCartney (Keith)  is the most unlikeable and creepy characters in the whole movie. He comes off as obsessive and intrusive. Keith seems to like Natalie despite her lack of interest in him. He practically forces her to like him throughout the first part of the movie. He starts to engage in behavior that is clearly relative to stalking and begins to ruin the relationships she has with her friends, family and boyfriend. He also distracts her from her obligations and aspirations. 
After endless rejections, she starts to actually like and care about him. However he's flips a switch on her once that happens. He starts to ignore and hide from her. She finds her way back to him and they end up having sex. After that he goes back to avoiding her. Eventually she finds out he has  cancer and is dying. 
Once Keith is confronted with this information, he confesses to Natalie that his goal was to pretty much ruin her life because she is privileged and he will never have what she has. It's completely manipulative and pitiful. 
Once he passes away, Natalie goes out to fulfill a plan that Keith failed to meet before his death 
First off, the acting is okay. None of the characters are believable except Natalie. I would say Natalie was the best part of this movie, despite me starting to dislike her midway through for her horrible decision making. The ""boyfriend"" was annoying but seemed like an okay guy who had legitimate concerns over the relationship between her and Keith. Also, the movie was very rushed. Especially at the end. I felt like the revelation of his cancer and eventual death was just so random And forced. He just randomly dies. I honestly didn't feel bad for any of these characters. . I was just annoyed by the whole thing. I definitely don't recommend this movie.<>Awsome. One of my favorites<>it was so weird, inconsistent and amazing. just like being a misunderstood kid. wanted more dialogue with these two. should have been a series. it was so different and the plot twists were just right. definitely an aquired taste.<>Cometely hardwrenching in all states, captures teen love and frustration. Also friendship and keeping those in the dark.<>This is an amazing film.  Every scene is amazing.  This is possibly the best movie I have ever seen.  I loved this movie.  The script is amazing.  This movie is really great.<>Picked this movie without much thought to pass the time on the treadmill not expecting much and it totally walloped me. It was beautiful. You really have to watch it twice. It is a totally different movie the second time because the dialog in the first 2/3 takes on totally different meaning.<>One of my favourite movies of all time.

On top of this, both the character and actor of the stupid blonde girl prevent any warmth between viewer and character. There is no love lost when somebody dies.<>A trip to the English countryside ends terribly for four travelers after they mistakingly take in a hurt stranger, who may turn out to be the notorious serial killer of local legend! Kelly Smith's slow-boiling thriller throws back to classic genre entries like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, but there is something severely lacking from the very start. We are immediately introduced to four terribly unlikeable characters: a cold and uncaring couple, the lead's lackadaisical sister, and her irate one-night stand, who only goes on the trip to escape the authorities for some unknown crime. The audience is so thoroughly annoyed by the time the four reach the cabin that we pray for some dark hero to come and kill them all, saving us from any further suffering. He does arrive, and they 'let him in' of course, so that things can finally get underway. What follows is a tedious back-and-forth between two potential killers as the women try to decide who to trust, but when Smith plainly tells the audience who the real villain is by depicting the first murder instead of alluding to it off-screen, there can be no mystery or suspense. It is best to heed the film's warning and DON'T LET HIM IN!

Watch and be mesmerised as this miserable tale unfolds.","Second best doc I've seen on The Clash so far. Really detailed, thorough run down of the band from start, but largely covering the agonizingly sad finish. And unlike so many music docs, this one had the real inside people involved; including members, friends, a long-time security person, media writers of the time, and more. Jones talk a lot about the band's time together, good and bad. Nice stuff from Viv Albertine, Gallagher, Donovan, and others. Would've been nice to have more band interview from the time, esp. from Strummer; or some of Simonon and Headon talking. 
I don't give a crap about the last yo-yos Rhodes and others brought in, as they were poseurs and stiffs really. But pretty strong work overall from director Garcia. 
3.5 stars<>A word of warning to anyone drawn to this film based on the title:  don't believe it.  This documentary isn't about the ""Rise"" of The Clash at all, and is only loosely focused on the ""Fall."" The majority of this oddly edited together film occurs after the band has been left in tatters.  I think?  I write that because the accounts being related by the various talking heads on-screen appear to move backward and forward in time, without a clearly identifiable timeline.  I also wasn't sure exactly what qualified many of the interview subjects to speak on The Clash - a brief introduction to each person speaking would have been helpful.  The film's greatest accomplishment is that Mick Jones is featured, but I have to believe his interview was heavily edited down, since he isn't talking about the music the band created, but rather, variously occurring, behind-the-scenes rancor, and therein lies the problem with this film.  The music they created together doesn't appear to be the film's concern at all - for example, ""London Calling,"" is mentioned one time that I counted - and insights about what it was like to create and play the band's songs was chief among the reasons why I chose to view the doc in the first place.  An inordinate amount of time is spent on the band's final album, which all involved are in agreement was a mess, with way more screen-time devoted to interviews with members who joined after the fateful Shea Stadium concert than is necessary.  Another of my chief complaints is that Topper Headon and Paul Simonon are completely missing from the documentary, while Joe Strummer's perspective is also puzzlingly glossed over.  I know there are tons of recordings of Strummer speaking about The Clash and other subjects.  Other voices either try to speak on behalf of the absent band members, or point fingers accusingly -- toward Joe, in particular.  About half-way through, the film shifts gears and nearly loses sight of the band that is supposed to be its focus.  Svengali-like figure, Bernie Rhodes, who was the band's manager for the majority of its history, becomes the central character at this point, with the minutes dragging on as interviewees talk about his destructive decisions and the rivalry with Jones, as they paint Strummer as an easily manipulated victim of success.  The incredible music of The Clash isn't just an afterthought, it's ignored almost entirely.  When I watch a documentary, I expect to learn something new about the subject being detailed.  Based on ""The Rise and Fall of The Clash"" alone, the band and its legacy remain well out of reach.  The great documentary chronicling the band once dubbed, ""The Only Band That Matters,"" might not yet have been made.  Instead of spending time with this one, I instead would recommend Julien Temple's excellent Joe Strummer documentary, ""The Future is Unwritten.""<>Almost unwatchable. Spent over half the film on the last two years without Mick Jones.<>Talked more about the last years of their career & hardly talked about their great records (first 3 in my opinion). Most of the film is about Bernie Rhodes their manager.<>Probably the best Clash retrospective. The first part of the film squeezes in the bulk of their era whilst the latter half focuses on the three years that led up to their demise.

Features contrasting views and includes witnesses that have never been interviewed before. Suffers from the same old voices making the same old populist points. 

Director Danny Garcia avoids an overdosed critique by concentrating on witnesses and participants rather than the disgruntled or tired media hacks.

There's a lack of a clear timeline but this is a minor point. There is also no reference to Top Risk Action Company or to the slate of songs that were replaced on the final album by fresher more electronic tracks.

It's left to Fayne, drum machine master to put the album in context and it is such insights that are too rare in the film. 

A good backing selection of clash and clash related backing tracks add to the film. Some of the live video footage is totally misplaced in terms of periods under discussion but splicing rare strummer interviews into the film adds to the focus. 

Ultimately Garcia fails in his original vision to rewrite the closing days of the clash and falls back in some part to a damning critique, I am sure influenced by the reasonable but negative comments of Nick Shepperd and Pete Howard.

It has the feel of an anti Bernie film with Bernie and his allies, Paul and Joe absent making it a one sided story. 

Finally Vince White. His contributions lead one to conclude two things. His behaviour then and now suggests someone with serious mental health problems and his raving drunken incoherent rants should never have been included in the film. 

If you're not a Clash fan you may find this film so niche it is for anoraks.","Robin Banks, Danny Garcia, David Mingay",,,,,,,

Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) is sent to Fort King in Florida to serve under Maj. Harlan Degan (Richard Carlson), who wants to rid the area of the Native American Seminole tribe. This plan sits poorly with Caldwell, whose childhood friend -- and rival in his pursuit of the lovely Revere Muldoon (Barbara Hale) -- is the tribe's chief, Osceola (Anthony Quinn). Tension between the Seminole and the army rises, and, when a guard is killed at the fort, the lieutenant is blamed for the murder.","Rock Hudson, Barbara Hale, Anthony Quinn, Richard Carlson, Hugh O'Brian, Russell Johnson, Lee Marvin, Ralph Moody, Fay Roope, James Best, Don Gibson, John Daheim, Howard Erskine, Frank Chase, Duane Grey, Walter Reed, Budd Boetticher, Howard Christie, Charles K. Peck Jr., Russell Metty, Virgil Vogel","Seminole (1953), directed by Budd Boetticher, is basically a Western set in Florida (and partially shot at Everglades National Park), during the Second Seminole War of 1835.<>Powerful pro-Native American Western, with gripping story telling.<>It's the kind of Western where the white leader is so crazed and the Indian leader so sane, that you root for the Indians.","At Fort King, Florida, in 1835, Lieutenant Lance Caldwell (Rock Hudson) is charged with the murder of a sentry. At his court martial, he recounts the story of the fragile peace between the settlers and the native Seminole and how that peace is threatened by the strict fort commander, Major Harlan Degan, who wants to wipe out the natives. Caldwell's childhood sweetheart, Revere Muldoon, meets Osceola, a Seminole chief and old friend of Lt. Caldwell's. Through respect for Caldwell, Osceola comes to the fort under a flag of truce, but is imprisoned by Maj. Degan. Osceola dies while in captivity and Caldwell is accused of his murder and jailed. Eventually, the truth comes out and the Seminole rescue Caldwell from his prison...

This 1953 American Western depicts the Second Seminole War (1835-1842) and is considered exceptionally realistic in its portrayal of the flaws in U.S. strategy during the Second Seminole War, its portrayal of Jesup, U.S. military uniforms and weaponry of the time period, and American social norms pertaining to race and gender. The film was also considerably ahead of its time in its overwhelmingly sympathetic and realistic portrayal of the Seminole people. Rock Hudson as Lt. Lance Caldwell, Anthony Quinn as Osceola and Richard Carlson as Maj. Harlan Degan all shine. Lee Marvin as Sgt. Magruder has just a supportive part, but his presence is there. Nice action sequences for being made in 1953. 

Historical Accuracy: Osceola was arrested under the treacherous and unwholesome circumstances which the film portrays. The character of Major Harlan Degan is based on the real life General Thomas Jesup who eventually had to resign in disgrace over the incident. The name ""Jesup"" was abruptly changed to ""Degan"" at the last minute, only days before filming started, to prevent being sued by living descendants of Jesup. The ambush in which Jesup and his men attempt to kill an encampment of Seminole while they're sleeping, only to find they've bayoneted bales of straw wrapped in blankets and disguised as sleeping people, is based on a real incident; Jesup attempted to ambush a Seminole encampment in between what is today Umatilla, Florida and Lake Yale and the Seminole carried out a counter-ambush in which Jesup was wounded, most of his men were killed and he was carried to safety (after being shot with an arrow) by two of his own soldiers.  (via Wikipedia)<>An excellent action packed story about the Seminole rebellion of the 1840's brightened in technicolor! Sure its a low budget movie and it shows throughout the fake Spanish moss and quicksand, but the color of the jungle setting along with the uniforms and warpaint is enhanced significantly! And what a cast! Rock Hudson, Anthony Quinn, and Barbara Hale are the lead stars, but an unknown (at the time) Lee Marvin also appears in this film. And to the Gilligan's Island fans, Russell Johnson (aka the professor) has a small role in the movie. This movie contains an unusually sympathetic tone towards the Seminole Indians; ultimately the capture of their land is presented as pointless and the commander in charge of the destruction of the Seminole is depicted as a mentally ill, racist, run-by-the-book major. The movie concludes with a hopeful attitude of peace between the army and the Seminole.<>a good Florida western filmed in the Everglades nice horses to more then Distant Drums.<>Better than average drama with a decidedly pro Indian slant was one of the many films Rock cranked out on his way up. He gives a good performance, one of his better early ones, as the resolute soldier who is on trial for his life. The cast is full of familiar faces most of whom were also just starting out and would go on to great fame like Lee Marvin, in good guy mode here, and Russell Johnson. Richard Carlson is the sore spot in the picture, he starts out okay but ends up chewing the scenery in an over the top performance. Barbara Hale was never particularly well served by films having much more success on TV as Della Street on Perry Mason nor is she very well used here but she looks probably the best she ever did on screen beautifully shot in Technicolor and with one of the greatest character names ever, Revere Muldoon. Not really a western, not even set in the west but Florida this is an enjoyable picture especially for military history buffs.<>Not great and marred by its obvious message. However, Boetticher's direction is very good and the film has some  powerful sequences.<>Decent Western with Rock Hudson arriving as a scout to a mad mans command, Unable to see eye to eye on Seminole Indian matters turmoil ensues as one man is driven by his own success , and the other is driven by a moral code. The ending was a little too easy for me, it should have ended with the path that the film seemed to be taken. But that would not be your typical Hollywood ending at that time.",Howard Christie,,,,,,,

Awesome, cuz historical drama about the statehood of the Republic of Texas. Good thing Texas became a state, rather than an independent counry, competing with, & disuniting what is now the USA.  Another great argument for Manifest Destiny.  Great CAST:  Gable, Ava Gardner, Broderick Crawford.  Lionel BARRYMORE as President JACKSON.
SAM HOUSTON portrayed as very heroic statesman FOR statehood.
CRAWFORD as wanting TEXAS as independent nation/ empire.  Supported by FRANCE & ENGLAND, to keep Texas from joining Union with USA.
Lotta romance twix Gable & Ava (""a whole lotta woman"").
Giving it max 5 stars on RT, cuz of the subject matter, and cast. 
Finally saw 70 years later, on tv Aug 3, 2022.
& watching a good bit of it again Jan 20, 2023.<>Nobody paid any attention to the real history.  This movie struggles to retain its B-grade movie status by involving histrionics of all kinds.  The script itself is a mess and its a wonder anyone signed on to do this.<>Clark Gable leads a cast including Ava Gardner and Broderick Crawford, in this political-western. Texas is a free state, the United States sends Clark Gables character out to Houston to welcome Texas in the union, while they fear annexation- Gable and Crawfords character fall into a romantic relationship. 

Very talkative western that may go down better for fans of Clark Gable. I can only see one scene with Gable and that's Gone With the Wind. A couple gun shots and horse chases and good one liners ""I'm a man with a gun, and I'm calling you a liar!"" For any action-type westerners you may want to look for something with less jibba-jabba and more Leone. A generic Western, squeaky clean with it's violence, if any and always ends in love and happily-ever-after. ""Geronimo, my saddle-bags.""<>Talky western about a group of Texans debating feuding over whether they want to become a state or remain independent. Clark Gable leads the good guy who are fighting budgie Broderick Crawford. There are a few rousing action sequences, but it's not quite enough to make this much of a memorable western. The film also features Ava Gardner, Lionel Barrymore and Ed Begley. But full disclosure, I'm not a Gable fan, so maybe fans of his would like this film better.<>141229: Really enjoyed the Gable & Crawford paring. Just a neat film with great acting. Not sure how historically correct it was, but it was interesting to me in that regards anyway. After a bit of research I found out that, coincidently, I watched this film the same Texas was admitted into the United States in 1845.<>gable & gardner=good lusty western<>Lone Star (1952)

No, this isn't the John Sayles murder mystery from 1996.  

This is a strange B-western set just after Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto.  The war with Mexico is over and Houston (Moroni Olsen) is tired of the U.S. debating over whether to let Texas enter into statehood as yet another slave state.  Mexico has stated if they join the U.S. that the peace treaty is off the table.  So further war with Mexico is imminent, and U.S. troops will be needed to continue the fight almost instantly.

An aging Andrew Jackson (Lionel Barrymore) has assigned Devereaux Burke (Clark Gable) to ride down to the Texas Republic to see what the political feelings really are about them joining the United States.

Thomas Craden (Broderick Crawford) is for staying a republic and thinks that 
Texas can expand their republic to include California, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico territories to become almost as big as the U.S.  Naturally, Thomas feels that he can be the future president of this new republic.  He knows that Devereaux is coming to Texas and he and his men want to stop him before he tries to influence the Texans into going with the statehood idea.

Martha Ronda (Ava Gardner) is a woman who owns a local newspaper and is in Craden's court (and possibly even more) until she meets Devereaux.  She doesn't trust him, but is still willing to hear his side of the story.

I'm not sure how fast and loose this movie is playing with historical accuracy, but as a nice little 50's western, it's not bad.  This is not on TV very often so if you get an opportunity to see it, go for it.<>A realistic and amusing Portrait of the Tide of Events who lead to the Texan Accession to the United States of America and the American-Mexican War great Battles between the Texan and the Comanche, the Pro Autonom Texas and the Pro USA Texans and the Americans and the Mexicans<>The MGM production gloss is in full swing here and Clark Gable and Broderick Crawfor are the manly men doing' their thing. Ava Gardner is the love interest and she's less cocky and obnoxious than usual; Lionel Barrymore chews the scenery as Andrew Jackson in his own inimitable way. The close in battle with the Indians that Gable and Crawford have near the beginning is intense. The chase along the river and the final battle and duke-out between you know who is all pretty slam-bang as well. Okay. this is not history that I've ever heard of but it's great frontier stuff that should be entertaining.<>Wanna see Broderick Crawford phone it in? Then here's your movie.

Except here, the tensions and drama are not so much ""simmering"" as they are ""firebombing everything in sight."" These people are all nuts!  Not to mention brutally mean to each other. This film is not at all shy about getting crazy. I was dying with laughter at some scenes and squirming at others -- this one ain't for the easily offended.

Thank you for this opportunity to make this correction. I believe the review is totally inaccurate, the movie was most inspiring. 
If you look at where the main character came from and how he evolved both physically and emotionally, you will agree.
If the audience listens carefully, they will walk away with several jewels of knowledge, which has resulted in a great deal of personal growth for many in real life. I would hope that anyone who has had some of the more difficult life struggles would see this movie and be inspired to the seek the same changes in their life. The emotional growth is not fiction, but factual true life experiences by many, which has made this movie most unique.
After watching this movie one has the possibility of coming away with opportunities they never thought possible. 
The words of knowledge are many, it will speak volumes to the aidience. This is not just a film about a fighter, although it was well done, very engaging and entertaining. Twelve Round Gun is a unique screenplay whose time has come. This is an action packed film  physically with delivery by a almost incredible actor Sam Upton, who should be considered for an Academy Award not just for his amazing acting, but for this engaging screenplay which has resulted in a super movie.
This is one film that should not be missed.

But if you're a parent, grandparent, or anyone who cares deeply about the 13 or 14 year-old in your life, this film is for you.<>Starring the naturally sympathetic young actress Elsie Fisher, it's a vivid and sometimes quietly heartbreaking reminder of how awkward growing up can be.<>Bo Burnham's brilliant directing debut will take you back to the awful awkwardness of adolescence.<>It's a crime that Elsie Fisher hasn't won every award possible for her work as the lead, and Josh Hamilton also deserves praise for his performance as Kayla's dad...<>Alfred Hitchcock allegedly claimed ""drama is life with the dull bits cut out""; Eighth Grade instead makes the dull bits interesting. It is a surprising film - and a wonderful one.<>Eighth Grade reminds us of the familiar growing pains in that unbalanced time transitioning from middle school to high school.<>An unvarnished, pimples and all, look at adolescence and the anxiety that comes with it<>... an important movie that should be seen, thought about, and discussed, ideally with someone who's not your age.<>Eighth Grade has a way of hitting you right between the eyes with the real-life turmoil of being a teenager no matter how old you are now.<>Because of its aim to highlight the negative aspects that shape transitions into adulthood, the film poses a unique, profound perspective.<>Burnham's film gets the job done, delivering a fresh spin on the teenage angst genre.<>You really feel the awkwardness, the embarrassment, cringe-worthy nature of Kayla and other kids in school trying to act older than they are.","Very realistic and a really nice message to go along with it. I wish I was more like her in 8th grade, and I definitely think parents should let their children watch this, even though it has an R rating. I actually had to Google why this film was rated R, because it is not obscene in any way. Great film:)<>One of my favorite movies ever. Bo Burnham's directorial debut showcases his amazing skill to effortlessly craft scenes that feel real in every way that life feels real. Life can be gut wrenching, hilarious, and scary and what Eighth Grade does so well is it not only portrays these emotions but has a way of helping you recall moments of your own life that are reminiscent of what Kayla is experiencing. Kayla gets a sudden boost of confidence to sing karaoke, or lies to sound cool, or is mad at her parent for no clear reason, or feels like the entire world hangs in the balance during a game of truth or dare...these are all things that are instantly relatable regardless of what stage of life you are in. Elsie Fisher (Kayla) and Josh Hamilton (her dad) are both fantastic and made me laugh out loud and cry actual tears. I think Bo Burnham does a great job of showing kids as they are and holding up the mirror to older people showing everyone that none of us are really all that different. The cherry on top of any great movie in my opinion is the music, and the music in this one is absolutely top tier. It fits the mood and elevates the scenes in exactly the way it should.<>The perfect teen movie<>There is definitely something a little eighth grade'ish about the dialogue at times, but nothing can rob this classic Ugly Duckling story of its contemporary power. Brilliantly using the device of the 'advice blog' to knit together the struggles of its simply brilliant lead actress, it takes us all, young and old, into the world, familiar to many, unfamiliar to too many, of the use of social media to win and gauge popularity. It treats some real issues a little too lightly, and probably shouldn't have 'gone there' at all with one or two, but is an honest reflection of how the ancient negotiation of becoming an adult is being handled by generations who use their phone as a mirror, constantly interrogating themselves about whether they will ever be beautiful enough to fit in. That the cast throw themselves into this exercise with candour and sensitivity makes this a joy to watch, tinged with the evergreen sadness of witnessing someone on that lonely journey we all take to become who we eventually are.<>A fresh, unforgettable portrait of a graduating eighth grade girl trying to figure out what it means to grow up in an Instagram world.  Boys, sex, friendship, social anxiety, shyness--Kayla struggles to find her place, to fit in, to come to terms with who she really is without giving in to withering social pressures. Her father's struggles to connect with her were so true to life!  I loved the film:  Elsie Fisher is superb as Kayla Day, and Bo Burnham directs with honesty and sensitivity.<>The best acting performance from Elsie Fisher!<>Saw this in theatres and when it finished, I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Its soundtrack hits hard. It is raw, awkward, real, funny, and original. However the biggest piece is the emotion you feel for Kayla as she progresses into the story. It is felt deep inside, through each topsy turvy uncomfortable and tough bump on this ride. A truly spectacular, generational movie.<>In a sense, Bo Burnham has given the audience a mirror image of their early adolescent selves. However, not everything, such as technology, hasn't changed since the preceding generation. All generations of viewers may still relate to the fear, cringe, and want to fit in. Ellie did a fantastic job in the 8th grade role she was cast in by Bo. This article, which is not a movie, takes a chilly look at the risks and social awkwardness of growing up in the technological era, where increased sexuality and stimulation are prevalent in youth culture. Everyone should watch this movie, especially 8th graders who are transitioning to 9th grade, in my opinion.<>I really liked this film - its simplistic but in a good way. I felt I could relate to the main character and I liked how it seemed to be a case of her putting out an online identity, being this teenager who seems to be laidback and knowledgeable, when really she's clearly somewhat anxious and unsure and concerned about the basic issues (physical appearance, popularity, other peer pressures of young teenage-dom) most have to deal with at that age. This is very much a film focussing on modern technology and, more specifically, the social media age, with the main character being a vlogger. It felt very authentic to me, although I admit its been a while since I was in my awkward teens (being currently in my awkward thirty's instead(!)). I'd say its partly about self image and also self belief. There are quite a few scenes which include awkward silences, which is something I could relate to - I suppose for people of different personalities (people who aren't introverted or socially anxious etc.), it may seem a bit slow or boring but as I say, I related to it and it seemed pretty genuine, so I appreciated that.

I guess it might sound a bit cheesy but I didn't think it seemed unnecessarily cliched or cheesy in a negative sense, with perhaps the exception of one scene towards the end but it hardly ruined the film for me. Overall its a well made coming of age film, which I'd happily recommend. Oh yeah and...Gucci! (if you've seen the film then you'll understand).<>I couldn't take my eyes off!

Was never released on DVD so you'll have to watch it on VHS, which makes it that much more awkward. Both the overdubbing and subtitles are appalling but it adds to its charm. A snapshot of 90s consumerism complete with early video bootlegs, expensive flip phones and game boy cameras.<>Low budget Asian slick talking zombies in mall apocalypse. What more could you ask for. Full on good old campiness!<>This movie is no masterpiece, but it does have some good writing. The special effects aren't very good, and the camera is a little unsteady at times, but everything else is fine. One thing I like about low budget movies, is they usually make up for the terrible special effects with good characters, good story, few plot holes and other things that Hollywood sometimes forgets to do. It's not the best thing to ever come into existence, but I would recommend it to anybody who wants to see something original; Because it's about as original as you can get with zombies nowadays. (I'm not a professional reviewer. Can you tell?) I'm off to go see if I used these semicolons properly; however, before I go, four stars.<>Mildly amusing zombie horror-comedy complete with the general goofiness and bad acting we've come to expect from  asian comedies. A trip down memory lane back to the kinder, simpler times of the late 90s.<>Wow what a fun Movie. This is a film that knows what it is and stands as an excellent homage to the Romero zombie movies. This film is fun and so lax and plus an ending i didn't expect. If you want a good time but not go out of your way to focus on every frame then this is a good choice.<>Two deadbeat slackers are left to defend the mall after a virulent outbreak transforms the locals in to flesh-eating ghouls in Hong Kong's cult horror comedy, BIOZOMBIE! BIOZOMBIE is immediately impacted by the popular survival horror video games of the mid-90's, frequently breaking the fourth wall as it warning the characters to ""Reload"" or ""Find a Key"" with visual cues on screen, while also including character stats as they enter the fray. Unlike in the disastrous HOUSE OF THE DEAD adaptation, this is presented in loving homage and not through distracting breakaways. The influence of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD and American pop culture is clearly present as well, given the mall setting and the tendency towards wry, irreverent humor. Director Wilson Yip feels no need to rush in to the zombie outbreak, and allows plenty of time for comedic actors Jordan Chan and Sam Lee to win the audience over with their playful misbehaving. Once the virus overtakes the mall, however, there is a steady stream of bloody action and slapstick as our small band of heroes hack and slash their way to safety. Japan would capitalize on this same trend in WILD ZERO, VERSUS, and JUNK before America saw its own major zombie resurgence in the early 2000's beginning with RESIDENT EVIL, 28 DAYS LATER, and the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake.<>Slapdash ""comedy""  will probably appeal to somebody.<>Highly forgettable zom/com. ""Bio Zombie"" features a poorly structured tired plot, awful creature makeup, terrible special effects, lame gags, and sub par dubbing. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie; it's not even a shot and beer movie! I can't condone viewing this film in any state, intoxicated or otherwise.

At best, this attempts to be ""Dawn of the Dead"" meets ""Return of the Living Dead"" but fails in every respect. There are far better zombie films out there. Do yourself a favor and avoid this Chinese turd.<>Bio Zombie is a Chinese comedy/horror that focuses more on the comedy as it tells the story of two hustlers who work at a video store at a mall who become trapped inside with a pack of flesh eating zombies. The goofy humor becomes tiresome quickly and the characters both main and supporting are annoying. The two leads are unsympathetic as they are thieves and hustlers and they are also loosely responsible for the outbreak when they run over a military officer carrying a zombie making formula and then give him some to try to revive him. (in Their defense it is, for some reason, stored in a soda bottle). Once the zombies start to infultrate the mall, they are trapped inside with some other characters and the film basically focuses on the comic character interaction with some occasional zombie attacks here and there. It's not till the last ten minutes when we see more then 3 zombies and things turn somewhat serious, then the film basically ends with a headscratching conclusion. There is some OK gore but, nothing worth watching for and, as stated, the film has a lot of goofy humor and annoying characters with zero suspense or scares. Has a bit of a cult reputation and I can't figure out why. Totally forgettable.<>Its so funny!! But why is it in anime? Its not an anime",Joe Ma,,,,,,,

The jokes still feel fresh decades after the original release - perhaps even more timely now. Williams is underrated as a comedic actress, and proves her talent in this role. Definitely a unique take on a Christmas classic - worth adding to the collection.<>Love this version!!!!<>I thought this was cute and inventive, up until the conclusion. Vanessa Williams plays an overwrought, completely spoiled diva who's impossible to work for. Of course, she gets the Christmas Carol treatment. This does have some clever ideas up it's sleeve, especially with the making of the ghost of chistmas yet to come as a VH1 Behind The Music special LOL. Unforttunately, it all bizarrely comes crashing at the end, Williams doesn't really feel redeemed, instead it really does look like she's faking it, or Williams isn't doing a great acting job, or the script let her down.

Mostly because I was really bored and I was waiting for a show on VH1 to come on. Needless to say, I didn't really enjoy this. A Christmas Carol is a fine story on its own that doesn't really need to be modernized. It was way too modernized for my liking to be honest. Not to mention, this plot has been done to death so many times. It does have a couple of nice moments though. Plus, I like Vanessa Williams and I also have a soft spot for Kathy Griffin. I don't care what people say about Griffin, she's funny and she's really hot as well. Alas, this movie is really just a waste of time as you have already seen this story several times already.

I love the people who were interviewed, the detailed facts, and the music. I know that this documentatry could cause an uproar because of social media, but this documentary takes no punches. Overall, Miss Representation is a good documentary to watch.<>So reflexive... so perfect in so many ways. It's time to wake up and stand for our rights all around the world.

Media literacy needs to be taught in schools.<>- Little Miss Representation -

You can't be what you can't see.
That is one (of many) messages in Jennifer Siebel Newsom's documentary Miss Representation, which shines a harsh light on the obstacles women face in the media, the arts, government, and even the current culture in the United States.

You can't be what you can't see.

The film really made me think back to my own experiences growing up. When I was 13, I joined a small community drama group. My director for the next five years was a woman and, when I was 18, I took the reins to direct my first play: a from-scratch production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie that changed my life forever.

I've since gone on to direct, co-direct, or assistant direct a play, musical, or artistic endeavor of some kind nearly every year since then. Artistic direction is the most natural thing in the world to me. After watching this documentary, I wonder if it's because I, myself, had female directors as role models. But one thing I know for sure: I never doubted my abilities because I was a girl.

For women all over my country, being in charge is not the most natural thing. Did you know only 12% of the top grossing movies in the United States were directed by women? Or that Kathryn Bigelow is the only woman to win the Oscar for Best Director? Ever? Movies are about stories. Stories are about the human struggle. Surely women have just as many stories as men do... don't we?

In Miss Representation we are presented with face after face of women of all ages as they look into the camera to tell their stories. Teen girls cry as they recount crushingly impossible body standards. One actress, after being told repeatedly that she was ""too fat"" by her network, recounts how she had her TV show cancelled, only to be replaced by-ironically-The Drew Carey Show (a star whose heavier weight was a longtime trademark). Another actress regrets the facial Botox she received after being told by her agent it was the only way she could keep her contract.

The stories of high-profile women-including well-known actresses, and politicians like Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton, and Sarah Palin-are so deeply connected to our own experiences of high school, college, and entering the job market. Movies and TV shows have huge influence on how people, especially children, envision possible futures. But if the media is so derogatory toward the most powerful women in the US, media critic Jennifer Pozner asks, ""then what does it say about [the] media's ability to take any woman in America seriously?""

The film tackles a dizzying number of subjects, eras, and topics. It touches on the ""redomestication"" of women following WW2, when shows like ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Leave it to Beaver"" were created to entice working women back into the home and leave factory jobs open for the returning soldiers. A magnifying glass is held to the Christian Right / ""Moral Majority"", which pushed back feminism and massively cut media regulations in the 1980s. (Meaning that, for the first time in history, the media was pushing the interests of advertisers above all else.) Building on these recent histories, Miss Representation discusses what media representation means for both the girls and boys who grow up with such limited narratives.

If I'm being honest, Miss Representation lacks a noticeable artistic structure and engaging graphics. To get through the sheer volume of topics and information, the documentary bombards us: with statistics, with clips from television, with interviews and news broadcasts. There is enough information here to fill two-or even three-separate documentaries. On top of this, director Newsom's recurring narration and personal story feels disjointed and even, at times, a bit cheesy (which may be because her voice was not, I felt, a great fit for this kind of narration).

For all of its aesthetic flaws, Miss Representation reveals the extent of the problem and suggests solutions. The filmmakers give a microphone to dozens of incredible women-academics, researchers, businesswomen, performers, writers, musicians-and then, most importantly, listens to what they have to say. The film reminds us how powerful women are when we listen (to each other to ourselves)-and when we allow ourselves to be powerful.

The makers of Miss Representation also ask us to remember the power we have in numbers, and to learn to support and cheer for each other. Several stirring segments of the movie show that while women are likely to vote for, and support, men in leadership, men and women are less likely to support women for those same roles.

And so roles like Best Director and President and CEO keep passing from man to man-to man. Which is so mind blowing to me, because I've seen what spaces are like when women are encouraged to take the reigns! A young woman directed the funniest production of The Importance of Being Earnest that I've ever seen. A young woman directed me in the Renaissance epic Doctor Faustus, instilling in her cast a fierce dedication to text and of spitting poetry in iambic pentameter. These women, and the female entrepreneurs, clergy, and artists I see in my own circles, have shown me that I if I have a part to play, or a story to tell, I am more than capable of calling the shots. That's something I'll be able to take with me my whole life-and I'm ready for that to become the new normal.

As Alice Walker is quoted in the film, ""The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.""

It doesn't have to be this way. It can be so, so much better.

Had the opportunity to listen to the director during a speech and it forced her own narrative (primarily her pregnancies) into this larger issue just as much as it did in the film. The best segment was when the newscasters spoke to their own experiences in the field which highlights how much better the film could be if more experts of their field were involved.<>One of the most essential documentaries that addresses one of today's social problems as this one would give frustration on the unfair role of genderism has towards the society, mainly the female gender getting interfered from finding themselves outside of the sexist media. The presented facts and statistics, including visual examples of the infectious male gaze, made this documentary more than thought-provoking towards the extent of taking action by standing up against the system for equality. It's mostly thorough, with few topics that were understood prior, but the voices had addressed enough to provide the perspectives of the male gender's stance on their terrible actions thinking there are no consequences when being sexist. You'll be considered sexist if you chose to not see this important documentary as it the argument was nicely-crafted with excellent, generally insightful points. (A-)

(Full review TBD)<>There are some interesting things here, but they are sadly lost in this clumsily-edited huddle of talking heads and randoms opinions instead of being supported by solid arguments from people with qualification who could discuss these issues in depth and with a lot more consistency.<>This movie brings many societal problems into light that need to be addressed.

The story of Dusan Ilic (Gordan Kicic) who is employed at the Serbian state prosecutor's office, and gets a top secret case to investigate a war crime committed by a disbanded paramilitary unit was developing slowly with a pace perfect for an effective thriller. Maybe the way he manages to find Micun (superbly acted by Uliks Fehmiu) - who's the only surviving witness, had few ""holes"" in the story whose arbitrary coincidences undermine the story's believability. I could say that the screenplay was the ""weakest link"" and even the polished look and atmosphere couldn't cover some of the flows.

But I have to say that I enjoyed watching it, especially for a lack of excessive violence, profanity and nudity which somehow became a ""trademark"" for the new Serbian cinematography... we could all enjoy the events on the screen without distractions of the cheap ""tricks of the trade"". Of course, the problem with such approach of the director is that Serbian film theatre audiences have been conditioned into rejecting ambitious, well-crafted cinematic projects if they don't pander or resort to sensationalism... My thoughts are - it will be their loss!

The fault is not with any of the actors - they all portray their characters very well - but the script felt very tame, if not predictable. The music was good but it's clear that this is a movie specifically meant for children. It's clear that the movie did not have the same budget as High School Musical (not even close to it), so my guess is that the production was not expecting the movie to do well.
This movie was a disappointment, but made the time pass.<>É o filme da Sharpey mano. #teamsharpey<>It has good intentions, a charismatic performance from Ashley Tisdale and some funny moments but overall, Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure is a rushed, uninspired High School Musical spinoff with a weak story, a different ""feel"" from the main trilogy, even by spin-off standards, forgettable musical numbers and a cast of new characters that are nowhere near as fun or memorable as Sharpay's old schoolmates. I admire Disney for trying to give Sharpay a better conclusion to her character arc than what Senior Year offered but on the whole, it's what I was concerned the first HSM would be: a generic DCOM that panders to tween girls. At least Ryan's broadcast-only cameo was enjoyable.<>Acting as an epilogue to Sharpay's character. The film adds a tremendous amount of depth to her character but its doesn't out weigh the weak script and flat dialogue.<>Not as bad as ""direct to DVD Disney films"" go, yet still an overall pointless spinoff of the beloved ""High School Musical"" trilogy. Its strengths lie with the messages of the film and the development of the titular character, whos arc seems to stem from the HSM 3 version of Sharpay. Tisdale also gives her best performance as Sharpay and her fellow castmates do a fine job. Overall, it is quite watchable.
However, with a cliched story, poorly developed side characters, a weak first half, a bad soundtrack (mostly covers and poorly lip synced original tracks) and an abrupt ending, Sharpay doesn't prove her worth in her solo film.

That being said, afterwards I read an article discussing this movie and the Wikipedia article, and I suddenly became so angry. This movie was truly awful. Critics say it was minimalist, I say it lacked a complete plot and anyone writing positively about it simply is full of themselves. For the ignorant raters that gave this film an average rating of 3.9/5 or an 8.1/10, I see absolutely no justification for this.

There was a point in this movie that that went to another dimension and they are flying a huge electric guitar and fighting off the witch and it was exactly like Dragon Ball z the style of animation and the way they did fight, which actually made the Scooby gang seem like they were just pot plants they were just there to be there, and the thing that really got me, was when it was all an hallucination I was like Huh! They all dreamt all of that TOGETHER?!? Together! The big masked reveal was just a wtf moment! This have got to be one of the most laziest writing I have seen just to put the Scooby Gang in the story which was completely rendered pointless when they suddenly had powers in the end so they really were in another dimension fighting off creatures! What?!? 

This movie was very entertaining but I have to be completely honest, this movie would actually have worked amazingly if it wasn't a Scooby-Doo movie, if it was just a Kiss movie with them having powers fighting off a powerful witch from releasing Galactus into the world it would have been awesome because it completely felt like a superhero movie and nothing felt like a Scooby-Doo movie, even though the characters was there, all their scenes felt like they didn't need to be there because Kiss did all of the work, they were completely overshadowed by Kiss, especially the ending. The cinematography really shined by the ending, the big battle had such amazing visuals, I could have sworn it was Dragon Ball z; fist fighting through mountains. The sound was great obviously for the band singing and all the music but it was way too overpowering for the Scooby gang, making it too noticable that they didn't fit in what was happening at all. Even though this movie is really exciting, if you look at what happened and how it happened, this isn't a Scooby Doo movie it's just a Kiss movie.<>It's trippy and entertaining.<>Fantastic!!!

The mystery was pretty good and humorous, especially with the twist to the supernatural happenings throughout the film. Great music and performances from the members of KISS and the Scooby gang.

*Written a few years ago by Parker Mott

Arid. Thats what sums of Nuit de Chien. To really define what the film is would make me a confused liar. But Ill try to be as interpretive as a can, though I am not responsible for being mendacious from beyond here for what I write about the plot. I think it is about some fictional war, following Gregorys character, a man lost with himself who he should be working for and with. The film follows the meandering experience of this character through a bunch of catastrophic events. 

Though not nearly executed to the aptitudes of Children of Men, both films have the same premise of following a male character through a bunch of difficult decisions and violent occurrences. However, the film seems to struggle with an idea of a near-apocalyptic Germany run by a dictatorship. Though well-filmed, Nuit de Chien fails to understand each characters morals and the set pieces are clichéd and dull.
	
At first, Nuit de Chien looks like a World War 2 film, but the Nazi Army is not present nor any sense of anti-Semitism. There are suicide bombers, violent politicians, and then you have the protagonist, travelling through the whole story of terror. Some are out to kill him; some want to help him. However, the story of Nuit de Chien really serves no point and its ending raises an eyebrow on why one just sat 2 hours to be told a tale of some battle that is never really understood or serves any meaning to the audience. Whereas, Children of Men had a much better plot premise about how women can no longer reproduce, and each character in the film is unique and we care about them and their fate. 
	
At the end of Chien, it is sad but the story falls flat on telling the audience if the fate of Germany is bright or dark. But Children of Men told the audience that there is indeed hope for man kind. However, there are times when Chien shines (no pun intended) through its filming. The colors ooze off the screen and add a gloomy feel to the carnage on the screen. It is filmed in a dark shade for most of the film, since the entire film is at night, hence Night of the Dog (Nuit de Chien). 

But the acting at times is over-acted, which always a fatal issue to a story revolving around such serious context. These characters are one-dimensional and they all seem similar to each other, in terms of how they deliver lines, and their opinions towards the violent dictatorship. It doesnt generally have a bunch characters with various perspectives on the dictatorship. Sure, you have a suicide bomber opposing the government and Greggorys character is a rebel with a cause, but these characters are just dull formations of each other. However, Nuit de Chien is not all bad; it is, for the most part, entertaining, but can suffer from the syndrome of nostalgia; the films fatal issue. 
   	
On the contrary to fatal, there are no fatal flaws to the story, which is good, but it is hard for a war film to be good when it serves no meaning. Full Metal Jacket was so good because every character in the squad, even an extra on screen, was important to the audience. And the message is clear: We are living in a world of s**t. And Platoon was an introspective adaptation to Oliver Stones time spent in the US Army during Vietnam. Both films serve a purpose at least for the audience or the director (Stone), but here there is no true message at least that would make this film a memorable war flick.",,,,,,,,

There are, however, a few bright spots.
1) Bruce Boxleitner proves a veteran actor can deliver a good performance even when given nothing of substance.
2) We found considerable entertainment in seeing how many times we could name the movie from which some particular scene or element was stolen.

directed by Scott Wheeler.<>Painfully bad with cheesy (anything you'd care to comment on). Only after viewing did I learn that this film is a prequel to one set in a grim future that I'm yet to enjoy (or not).<>I knew this was going to suck from the start, but I only saw it because I was bored.

PLOT:In this prequel to the mockbuster Transmorphers, an ex-troop, his girlfriend (Jennifer Rubin), and her cop uncle have to figure out why robots are trying to take over the Earth and killing people. Simple sic-fi plot executed very badly.

ACTING:The acting is soooo, sooo bad that it's laughable. Rubin's dreadful, the ex-troop was bad, but the cop uncle was surprisngly decent for a movie of this stature. The rest of the acting except for one more person maybe was laughable and intolerable. Pain isn't crossed right, love is jumbled, and fear is bland.

SCORE:Indie music that actually isn't that bad.

EFFECTS:The effects were all cheap computer programs, but they weren't the worst I've seen. At some parts, it gave off that indie movie feel, but at some I laughed and shook my head. The prop and sound effects were truly pathetic. I laughed my ass off.

OTHER CONTENT:This movie is purely bad and can be laughed at more than hated. I gave it a one-up because of its ability to make me laugh. The only reason I really watched this is because I was bored and the explosions looked cool.

OVERALL,a horrible mockbuster with a badly executed plot, horrible acting, decent indie score, a mix of laughable and pure indie feeling effects, and the ability to be laughable bad.<>A stupid terrible film that has poor acting, a boring storyline, and horrible special effects.",,,,,R (Some Violence|Sexuality|Language),,,

Crystal and Hines. 
Crystal is hilarious. Hines makes a GREAT straight man to bounce off of. They are having fun working together and it shows...THAT makes it a great movie despite the Miami Vice plotline.<>I don't understand the hate for this movie. Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines were a match made in heaven, playing off each others creative talent. Should this have won an Emmy? Of course not, but it checks off all the boxes you'd want in a feel-good flick.

Running Scared separates itself from the crowded pack with unorthodox casting and the effortless chemistry between them.<>Average 80's film that struggles at times.  The plot is pretty loose.  There is decent chemistry between Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines, but I had a hard time believing them as cops.  It's not terrible, but it's certainly not a must see classic from the 80's.<>I should write more but this is a solid, funny movie. Should be in the 80s not the 50s here on Rotten Tomatoes. Some scenes are a bit dated and one scene is poorly like but it's solid for when it was made.<>The actors are in good form. The script isn't too focused though.

      There's much worse buddy cop movies though.

The key difference being that in Friedman's there are questions to the guilt of the offender, but in Family Affair, the guilt is laid out on the table. In a way, that is what makes this documentary so hard to watch and equally so compelling. Told from the point of view of the brother of three sister victims of their father, Family Affair is a dark look at what effect abuse can have on the lives and psyche of an entire family.  I expect this doc to get a theatrical release this year, especially with Oprah on its side.<>One of the most powerful and smart films I've seen this year. Certainly the most provocative and insightful on the subject of family secrets, which we all seem to have. A deeply moving account of forgiveness and courage.

A raw, real portrait of a family's ugly secret which was brought out into the open when the only male child of a family of four shot his sister accidentally while playing with his father's rifle.  Unlike 2004's ""Tarnation"", there are no frills here, interview after interview unfolds the inner feelings of every member of the house, from the abusive father to the children and their estranged mother.

But the rest of the film does much to redeem that dubious trope ...<>A documentary that purports to chronicle the sober and urgent work of those who ferret out human-rights abuses, but instead plays like a portrait of a rather glamorous marriage.<>It's a comprehensive portrayal of these people's personal and professional lives. We see what makes them tick. Are they adrenaline junkies? Thrill-seekers? Not at all.<>Four members of Human Rights Watch's Emergency Team risk life and limb in this dynamic and immersive documentary.","Interesting story! Wished there were more points of view of other human rights reporters<>What a thrill watching these dedicated people going into violent areas to help get the facts out to the world!<>Awful. Overly-dramatised, self-indulgent and clearly more interested in the 'E Team' personalities than the people and stories in Syria they profess to be focusing on.

In particular, the E Team member Anna is clearly a vain, egotistical Prima Donna who brims with self-importance and appears to have persuaded the editor to focus a lot of camera time on her ridiculous posturing and anodyne commentary. Anna, I dare suggest, would be better suited to a career on stage than in the field of human rights investigation. 

For anyone looking to watch a decent documentary on the Syrian conflict then I can honestly recommend HBO's Cries From Syria that focuses much more honestly on its subject matter than its producers.<>This is one of the best documentaries I've seen. It really makes you appreciate the concept of what true fear looks like, and makes you appreciate the safety of your home that people don't feel in other places. There's scenes of families terrified of air planes flying over head, I couldn't imagine living like that, and it saddens me there are cities of people living like that.<>These types of documentaries always do a better job of highlighting the immense terror individuals face during these atrocities than any news story ever could.<>A documentary that uses global issues to focus on four unique individuals, and what it takes to go into these environments. When it's focused on that, it works best. Of course, I cared about the issues affecting the people the E-Team represented, but I've seen some really great documentaries that go into more detail about these. What works better here is the investigation into what makes a person want to be on the E-Team, how does this affect their family, and their pyschological health. This is where the film best succeeds.<>such necessary, admirable work<>Unfortunately, a very disappointing propaganda film to support the false war on terror.The entire middle-eastern region is deliberately being destabilized by America, Israel and their allies. There is massive evidence now for the false flag operations which are being carried out in Syria by American agency officials who supply arms and funding to CIA terror organizations.Let's not forget that all wars are engineered by the Zionist elite, using their political puppets and the mainstream media to sell the lies to the ignorant masses that fail to research and question the mighty deception. As long as documentaries like these continue to be aired, there will ALWAYS be death and genocide because the gullible masses will continue to buy into it, continue paying taxes and continue to send their soldiers to fight these mythological enemies. The real enemies are those who control the money supply and the mainstream media and it has been that way for a very long time. Please research 'strategy of tension', 'psyop', 'Hegelian dialectic' and 'false flag terror'. The truth must be understood if we are to make any progress for future generations.

The special effects are well done and there is plenty of action. The cinematography is good also. The Music is forgettable and the editing is average. The pacing at the start is very slow but picks up quickly but gets weighed down quite often by scenes that don't contribute to the plot. This leads into really the biggest problem of the film which is just some dumb choices by characters at times and the annoying daughter also which just makes you roll your eyes instead of enjoying the destruction. Cool idea but just a mixed bag execution wise. Only if your a hardcore 90's fan watch this. Otherwise stay away.<>If Volcano can't compete with other disaster films, this film can still be considered a somewhat disaster film genre with its great performance by Tommy Lee Jones.<>This is one of my favorite movies.

The effects are mostly a little tacky but pretty cool. Not as good effects as Dante's Peak (1997) or The Day After Tomorrow (2004). The biggest fault is the fact that the whole movie is based on the most stupid premise ever. There are moments with dogs, children and even trains that are so painfully beyond belief that you just want to stick a volcano up your own bottom. Having said that there is fun to be had knowing that this is more ridiculous than Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings combined. Not knowingly campy, this is a shame.<>I saw this in theaters as a kid and it scared the crap out of me and gave me nightmares for years. I watched it again as an adult and thought it was the funniest movie I'd seen in a while.

The callousness and sheer inhumanity spoken of will leave you hollow, and livid that something so horrible actually took place on American soil.<>Funded in part by the Sundance Documentary Fund and directed by Alison Maclean ([i]Jesus' Son[/i], [i]Crush[/i]) and Tobias Perse, [I]Persons of Interest[/I] examines arbitrary arrest, secret detention, and deportation of Muslim and Arab immigrants in the immediate aftermath of the 9-11 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. The United States Justice Department under the leadership of the Attorney General, John Ashcroft, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, arrested and detained more than 5,000 Muslim and Arab immigrants on suspicion of posing a threat to national security. Of those 5,000 arrested and detained, most have been released without prosecution and conviction. Of that subgroup prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department, none have been convicted of any crimes related to terrorist activities in the United States. None received an official apology from the U.S. government.

[I]Persons of Interest[/I] unfolds as a series of static, on-camera interviews with twelve Muslim and Arab immigrants (and their families). The interviewees, often in halting, broken English, openly discuss their arrests and detentions in the immediate aftermath of the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the United States. The detainees were refused legal representation or contact with family and friends.  Some of the detainees were held in undisclosed government facilities, in some cases as long as a year. At the end of their detention, the detainees were released without prosecution or arrest (although at least one of them, an Algerian immigrant with a Latino wife and several children, was immediately deported to another country).

For example, Nabil Ayesh, a Palestinian immigrant, was arrested at a stoplight in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. He was held in detention for an entire year and seventeen days. He was never charged, but his wife and children were deported to the West Bank in the Palestinian Territories. After his release, he worked as a contractor, before another traffic stop in April 2003 led to his detention and eventual deportation to the West Bank. Syed Ali, a businessman married to an American woman, was arrested after a former business partner accused him of being a terrorist. The only connections the FBI found to the 9-11 attacks were a visitors pass to the World Trade Center and a flight simulator game owned by his American-born teenage son. Ali was held for over 100 days in detention in Rikers Island. He lost both family and friends over his arrest. He also lost his business, and now operations a limousine service. Mohammed Irshaid, a civil engineer who worked on the 59th-Street Bridge in Manhattan was arrested at his job site and held for three weeks. As a consequence, Irshaid lost his job. Although all three of his children have been born and raised in the United States, its likely he and his family will relocate to Jordan in the next year. Salem Jaffar, an elderly man whos lived in the United States for several decades, was arrested outside a Burger King in Buffalo, New York. He was charged with car theft (for driving an overdue rental car). He was held for more than a month in solitary confinement in a windowless room under 24-hour lighting. In frustration at his treatment, he engaged in several hunger strikes in order to obtain information about the charges against him. He was later tried and acquitted of the rental car charges. Nonetheless, Jaffar was forced to pay more than $25,000 dollars in legal fees. 

Karim Tebbakh, married to a Latino-American woman, was arrested on September 18, 2001 at the supermarket where he worked. For three months, his wife, Amanda Serrano, could not obtain information about his detention. In detention, Tebbakh also engaged in several hunger strikes. Following a year and a half in government detention, Tebbakh was deported to his native Algeria, where he was held in a military prison for ten days. Tebbakh can never return to the United States. Faiq Medrag, another Palestinian and father of three children who still live in the Middle East, was held in detention for more than three months. His crime? He had postcards of the World Trade Center pinned to the deli case where he worked. He is currently seeking political asylum. Shokriea Yahghis husband, Ali, was deported to Jordan after being held in a special housing unit of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn for more than nine months. Ali Yahghi, the father of three American-born sons, owned a pizzeria and was active in his local mosque. His sons now live with him in Jordan, while his wife continues to live in the United States, in order to pursue a lawsuit based on the infringement of his constitutional rights against the United States government.

In each case, arbitrary arrest (using, at most, racial profiling as a basis for arrest) was followed by secret detention, and the suspension of basic constitutionally guaranteed liberties, such as the right to legal counsel and the right to a speedy trial or hearing. Certainly, the U.S. government must safeguard the safety and security of its citizens from terrorist attack, but the real question here (unfortunately left unexamined in the documentary), is the balance that needs to be struck between national security and civil liberties, for U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike. Even allowing for the immediate, unsubstantiated arrest and detention of so-called suspected terrorists, the burden shifts on the U.S. government to provide legal representation within 24- to 48-hours of detention (as well as disclosure to immediate family members of that detention and the place of detention), and a full and impartial hearing before a neutral arbitrator within a reasonable time frame. Charges, if any, should be brought within a maximum of several weeks to a month, and a hearing should follow soon thereafter. The U.S. government should also be prepared to compensate detainees for all lost wages and legal fees (and, if necessary, provide job assistance for those detainees who have lost their jobs as a result of arrest and detention). Constitutional due process (as enshrined in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution) should not be abrogated in the immediate or long-term after of terrorist attacks (or in the so-called war on terrorism).  Governments, if they err at all, should always err on the side of civil liberties. And even when the government does err, they should be held accountable to the American public.","Lawrence Konner, Jackie Kelman","Jan 22, 2004 original",,,,,,

Thanks, very good to see<>This movie is PHENOMENAL!!! At first it seemed like it could be a nice dramedy like Garden State but it is WaAAy deeper that that! It is multi-layered and very cleverly written... it talks about responsibility of our generations and the fact that the highest % of single mothers in US are black, furthermore, through its female lead, a German tourist, it suggests that Western European women are least likely to be mothers (CIA facts) in modern day... more, it cleverly interpolates Latino population's strong family values as well as the omnipresence of Asians who are quietly multiplying. This movie boldly lets its protagonist be on the escape from life, or as Jean Paul Sartre (quoted in the movie) once noted ""the hero of our time is the man on the run"", making his Dream almost seem like an antagonist. It beautifully penetrates in the psychology of one's conflict with ""letting the change happen"" and questioning one's one roots of ambition and outlook on life. The Music (phantom band ""Blonde Priest"" which nobody's heard of) really provides a unique narration to the story as well as characters inner monologues.

WEAK<>This movie is good for kids. I enjoyed it though I felt the story telling was a bit poor as the characters due to the plot are continously on the move and less time for character development.

I also found a huge movie mistake while watching. When x creature confesses their plans another in a completely different location suddenly is aware of this and comments on it to another. It's not a movie ruiner but just saying it could've easily been avoided. This is a kids movie though.

Other than that the story holds up fine, the story telling is good enough and it will keep kids invested.

Have you been drinking again?","Garbage... pure garbage!  Casting American Pie's Thomas Ian Nicholas, Baywatch's Nicole Eggert, and cartoon voice expert and Oswald from The Drew Carey Show, Diedrich Bader doesn't mean a film will be funny.  No, this is a terrible film in soooo many ways. 
I get the concept and it has potential for some funny but between the terrible casting, writing, and lame production, Cattle Call just ends up being a true waste of everything involved... including my time.<>Yes, it's an inconsequential piece of fluff and yes National Lampoon is really hit or miss (mostly miss in my opinion, excepting those treasures that are Animal House and the Vacation/Griswold movies), but I actually thought this was pretty funny. It's not breaking any new ground, but it does have great cast, decent story, some good laughs, and some lovely ladies. Great filler when you have an hour and a half to kill.<>Mediocre at best. Possibly the worst National Lampoon movie I've seen.<>Can I give zero stars?  Awful. All the production values of my Dad's home moves from 1966. And hello, makeup? Every actor is shiney.<>Wasn't bad, kind of an average movie.<>A very poor low budget comedy with Thomas Ian Nicholas of American Pie. It has a few familiar faces, but this is just a rather odd film. It tries to be a bit cheeky and border on a sex comedy but fails pretty bad. Some scenes are just totally random?! Stick to the American Pie series or some of the better known comedies of recent years for more laughs.<>For a T&A film, this is uninspiringly bland. Barely funny with a sappy conclusion.<>When I read the Plot it was sold for me as a funny interesting movie and boy was I wrong! The premise of the movie was good; it was just the movie itself that was bad and the exposition of it too. You're thinking, ""National Lampoon""? It must be funny! No. It's not funny. No laughs, no chuckles, certainly no guffaws. It's not even mildly interesting.

This is essentially a one joke movie, and the joke is unoriginal, redundant, and boring. Most of the crude efforts for a laugh totally misfire, and the overly simplistic script simply has nowhere to go. The entire film seems tired from beginning to end. Throw in the towel early, because essentially you will not miss anything you haven't seen before.

Three deadbeats set up a fake casting agency. Using very little or no money. I think they also tried to do the movie this way! They rent a studio-like office and convince hundreds of desperate women that their stupid questions about sex and men have some connection to a movie audition.

They get caught out and are sodomized by some butch lesbians with electrical implements, charged with fraud, go to trial, then, in one night, magically pull together some bits and pieces of video-tape, sufficient to convince a judge it was for real all along.

Oh, and the main deadbeat gets the beautiful girl anyway. That actually sums it up!

Diedrich Bader had a very weak performance in this movie and Thomas Ian Nicholas showed me again why there really isn't anything special about him. Although there were a few times where I laughed, the romantic parts felt like I was watching a bad TV-movie. If I were you, I would approach this movie with caution; you'll like it if you're a die-hard National Lampoon fan you'll be disappointed.

In Los Angeles, three guys with limited social lives hatch a plan to meet women: they'll issue a casting call for an independent film, interview actresses, and ask out the ones who interest them. Glenn is a nerd, but he has the office. Sherman has the idea - he's a hound, happy to lie, eager to meet and bed as many women as he can fool. Richie, who owns the camera, hopes to meet his true love. Within a few days, he's fallen for Marina Dell, new in town, with a boyfriend back east; Glenn is ga-ga for Laurel, and Sherman can't say no to the eager and adventurous Nikita. But how long can they sustain the fiction, and what about real feelings?

A guy starts a fake casting agency in hopes that he will meet his soul mate.<>National Lampoon continues to deliver low-scale, unfunny direct-to-DVD crap, and Cattle Call is no exception. Cattle Call has best friends Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie trilogy), newcomer Andrew Katos, and Diedrick Bader (The Drew Carey Show) comes together to hold fake casting calls for a fake movie in order to meet and score with hot women. Naturally, they all find some winners and losers. Some fall in love, while some cause trouble, eventually leading to the discovery of your shady scandal, where they get in trouble, but try to redeem themselves and blah, blah, blah. A good 95% of this film's ""comedy"" is just downright awful. Most of the women are nice to look at, and some decent titties pop up here and there, unfortunately those titties do not belong to Chelsea Handler (of the Chelsea Lately show) nor Nicole Eggert (of Baywatch) who I would have love to seen both naked. There are only a couple of redeeming moments, specifically a scene involving TV/cartoon legend Jonathan Winters (in a genuinely funny role) and some courtroom banter between the judge, D.A., and public defender that is also genuinely funny. The rest of this movie bites the big one. In fact, a more appropriate name would have been National Lampoon's Cattle Shit. Waste of time movie.<>Very cute little romantic romp.

The premise, or at least the stuff that holds it together, to 'Nikki, Wild Dog of the North' is rather light; particularly for the first and second acts, the third has a little more meat on the bones.

There's also extremely questionable animal welfare, a lot of it could be trained but it's difficult not to be cynical with some of the stuff you see - especially across the opening twenty minutes. It affected my enjoyment, way more than a few other Disney films with similar issues.

Cast-wise it's almost non-existent, Jean Coutu and Émile Genest are solid as Andre and Jacques respectively. Jacques Fauteux narrates the film, he is arguably the only good part to this - his delivery is near perfect.

I can't honestly say I liked this as I simply didn't, the animal stuff alongside the weak plot makes for uninteresting viewing. Each to their own, as always.<>Want to find out when this was first shown in theaters or drive-ins.

In this film Nikki gets lost with a bear cub and they try to find there owner, but the bear cub goes his way as Nikki goes on.If you have never seen this movie you will see animals do things that had to take months to capture on film, This is a real Walt Disney film, unlike the films of this day and age wiith the name Disney on them, Walt is turning in his grave.

They are emblems of expressive freedom, having built a repertoire of performance spanning from television and Music Hall to drag and nude theatre. Novices and performing arts professionals alike travel from Europe and the US to hone their skills and expand their craft under the methodical chaos of Barry and Joan's workshops on Vaudeville, Eccentric dance and Commedia dell'Arte. This tale of two national treasures is a rallying cry for uniqueness and self-expression in an increasingly box shaped world.","Barry Grantham, Joan Grantham, Audrey Rumsby, Eric Pomert, Audrey Rumsby, Helena Sardinha, Rafael Thomaseto, Catherine Bonwick, Rick Cresswell, John Torreano, Eric Pomert, Rick Cresswell, John Torreano, , Joan Grantham, Patrick Hogan, Nick Perez","Loosely structured, it relies a bit too much on its stars’ loveableness, but they do possess that quality in spades.<>Barry & Joan is a delightfully quirky film, informative and funny, and capturing a couple of troupers who are two of our few remaining links to vaudeville.

When he wants to end the dalliance with Carmen, she is so distraught that she becomes suicidal. Seizing the gun from Carmen, he accidentally shoots her, and thinking she's dead, concocts a series of increasingly outlandish alibis to cover his tracks under the guidance of a ghostly apparition that is his alter ego.","Claude Rains, Margo, Whitney Bourne, Stanley Ridges, Leslie Adams, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur","It is a superior picture, well out of the ruck, impressively acted by players whose names are mostly unknown.<>[Crime Without Passion] presents the Hecht-MacArthur writing team in the new role of producer-writers in an attempt, they tell us, to prove that good pictures can be made with a maximum of intelligence in a minimum of time and expense.<>Murder from a slightly different angle.

He's dating nightclub performer Margo, who he wants to dump for his socialite girlfriend Whitney Bourne, who he truly loves.  He sets up a meeting between Margo and her ex Stanley Ridges, and then uses it to accuse her on unfaithfulness.  She confronts him, and he accidentally kills her.    He uses his legal talents, manifested by a ghostly image of himself who he converses with, to construct an elaborate alibi for himself.  This film was the directorial debut of writing team Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, although cinematographer Lee Garmes claimed he did most of the practical work of directing it.  That's a plausible story since this is an a visually complex flick that opens with a really bravura sequence depicting the furies causing people to murder and suffer the consequences.  Rains seems to really enjoy playing an unrepentant slime ball.<>good post-code suspenser starring the fab Margo<>Crime Without Passion is almost an existential film about a famous, cocky attorney who suspects his mistress is seeing other men.  When he confronts her, he accidentally shoots her.  Using his knowledge of criminal justice, he attempt to cover up all the evidence which could lead to his arrest.  This film features one of the most amazing opening sequences ever, which uses all sorts of visual camera tricks which are really quite revolutionary, especially for the time.  The film never really quite lives up to the beginning but it is still a strong film.  As our attorney tries to cover up his crime and get an alibi, the viewer is subjected to his internal dialogue, which tells him what to do.  The film is very experimental and unique give that is was made back in 1934.  As one would suspect, the script is really fantastic and Claude Rains is very fun to watch as the uber-succesful, philosophical attorney.<>This film stands apart from most other old movies, because the screenplay, written by Ben Hecht, intends not to entertain, but to instruct (though it lacks the hokey didacticism of Back Door to Heaven). The hero is Lee Gentry, a standard Hechtian (or Randian, if you're unfamiliar with Hechtâthe approximation is close enough) Ã¼bermensch, a misanthropic, calculating criminal defense lawyer with little respect for anything but the power of his own mind.

He no longer cares for Carmen, a cabaret singer he's dated for two years (having stolen her from his once friend, Eddie White), and he's moved onto a sturdy blonde, but he can't seem to break it off with Carmenâshe is too melodramatic and he hasn't the heart. But his blonde demands it, and so he crafts a scheme, to ""catch"" her cheating on him with Eddie White (though she did nothing of the sort) and thereby grant himself the right to break it off.

This plan works, until he gets a raving telegram from Carmen, in which she threatens suicide. At her house, he and she fight over a pistol, and he accidentally shoots herâshe falls down dead. The phone rings. An apparition of his ego appears, and instructs him; answer the phone, but mask your voice. Pocket the gun; pick up your crumpled boutonniere; go to the theater to create an alibi. Gentry seems to have structured things perfectly, but, in a Dostoevskyan twist, he is wracked with guilt, and confesses to the blonde. Revolted, she leaves him.

Again, the apparition appears, explaining to Gentry that this is perfect; he can now go to Carmen's theater for her showâdemonstrating that he doesn't know she has been killed. But there, things don't go well. He runs into another showgirl who says she saw him at the theater when she was waiting for her new boyfriendâbut an hour later than the time Gentry insists it was (which is the time he was in Carmen's apartment). Worried, he decides to silence her with romance, madly promising her furs and jewels, if only she'll leave with him immediately.

Cut to the dressing room, where Carmen is lying down, but insisting she's well enough to go onâshe's not dead at all! Only had been in a faint all along. Back outside, while Gentry's hands are on the showgirl, her new boyfriend comes in; it's Eddie White, again. The two men scuffle and Carmen's gun, still tucked in Gentry's pocket, goes off. Eddie White is dead; Gentry is immediately arrestedâit's an open and shut case with one hundred live witnesses and a clear motive.

At the police station, Gentry, alone for a minute, receives another visit from the apparition; it tells him to kill himself immediately, rather than wait for the chair. Gentry puts the gun barrel in his mouth, but his hands shake; he can't do it. The police officer confiscates the weapon, and the film is over, with the certain implication of Gentry's death by electrocution.

Hecht was, for a time, my favorite author (the time that I was between 17-21 years old, wore black ball gowns and Victorian boots, and saw nothing wrong with Ayn Rand's conception of the world). There is still something about his self-punishing snootiness (like all his heroes, he was too intelligent for his society, too good for this earth, and therefore suffered suffered suffered) with which I still guiltily identify, something that I don't want to be but feel that I can't help being. It is the thing that made me ask to play Lady Macbeth in grade school Shakespeare productions, the thing that made me read Nietzsche in college. Like Hecht, I fight it, lest I end up like one of his sick characters.",,,,,,,,

Whilst Meryl Streep puts in a typically excellent performance, she cannot save this.

Both were good, with the play demanding more work to understand than the film. More words of explanation in the play, and it was lovely to see how these were translated into facial expression by the actors in the movie. A good ensemble cast, all five sisters well characterised. There were differences of emphasis between the two scripts, with a a couple of plot lines which differed completely.

Expected so much more.

Despite an intriguing concept, 'Tobruk' bored me from almost the very beginning. It gives you absolutely zero reason to care for the characters, aside from the obvious that is Allies v. Nazis; that's lazy, more depth is needed for Craig and the rest. I didn't connect to them one jot.

The aforementioned can be ignored if the acting and premise is a cut above, neither of which are unfortunately. Even minutes after watching, I'm struggling to remember any of the faces except for Rock Hudson (Craig) and Norman Rossington; who plays the somewhat amusing Alfie.

Premise-wise it has potential, though it never lifts off the ground. For the majority it's simply  dull, even when the action eventually arrives at the conclusion I had very little interest left in me.

I do appreciate how the film looks and a couple of the shots, but even there there's issues. As most is set in the desert, it never feels like you're moving toward Tobruk; most scenes feel way too similar. The music is poor also, with a lot of empty silences throughout.

This probably should be getting a lower rating, but there's something nagging away at me suggesting anything lower than 2* would be unfair; perhaps the film just doesn't click with me?

War history enthusiasts may love this, but in my opinion it's an extremely underwhelming production.<>Tuesday, July 29, 2014

(1967) Tobruck
WAR<>Fairly conventional WW2 movie.  Unfortunately, the movie has nothing to do with the famous battles for Tobruk.  Instead, the plot revolves around a fictitious raid on Tobruk by British troops in WW2.  Nothing new here - this could be The Guns of Navarone, or any similar movie.

Solid, though often stereotypical, performances all round.<>Great ww2 film with Hudson and Peppard. This film follows a SIG team (German/Palestinian Jews dressed as Nazis fighting for the Allied forces) alongside with British Commandos and one Canadian(Hudson) acting as their prisoners. With a spy within their group and a wast desert to cross, There is bound to be difficulties obtaining their mission. Mainly blowing up Rommel`s fuel deposit in Tubrok. I loved the scene where they trick the axis of evil to fight eachother. Priceless.<>a movie with a satisfying conclusion
2 slow acts building up to a grand finale
the presence of war flows through the story as a group of soldiers make the ultimate sacrifice to thwart off the threat of Tobruk
it asks what's bigger than the war itself: following orders or dying for a noble cause?<>One of the great 60's war films, right up there with The Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen and Where Eagles Dare, which all presented World War Two as a great visual spectacle.

In this particular film we have Rock Hudson, portraying a Canadian military officer, being rescued from capture by the French in North Africa by a group of Jewish German commandos under the leadership of George Peppard, here in one of the many action roles he worked in before he became the leader of the A-Team on television. The Jews want to fight back against their Nazi oppressors and have a definite axe to grind, and the British just want to see Rommel's advance towards Egypt stopped dead, and to do that they mount an ambitious, suicidal mission to destroy his fuel depot in Tobruk, using these Jewish soldiers and Hudson, who is familiar with the desert and its terrain.

It's a top-notch cast, with many well-known British character actors, and it certainly is a fine action film which has no bones about showing the Germans as formidable opponents, which they certainly were.<>Respectable war film, nicely produced. It has a tendency toward melodrama, but it had suspense, some good action scenes and i has a fine score. For the most part, the acting is good.<>Respectable war film, nicely produced.

It has some witty one liners amongst the drama, it has a great cast with Peppard playing a superb role and Hudson playing a true hero.

Its such an interesting film  as to see a battle undemined as it was crucial; it is a real classic.<>wow umn just seen this movie 4 the 1st time n think that this is a good movie 2 watch..its got a good cast of actors/actressess throughout this movie..i think that rock hudson, george peppard, nigel green all play good parts throughout this movie..i think that the director of this Drama, Classics movie had done a good job of directing this movie because you never know what 2 expect throughout this movie..i think that the fight scenes n the gun shoot outs are pretty kewl throughout this movie..its a good movie 2 watch",,"Feb 7, 1967 original",,Universal Pictures,,,,

This film is boring and it's an insult to the original. Also there is barely any scenes with werewolves.

An author retreats to a small town named ""Drago"" where she hopes to gather her thoughts and rebuild her career.  She falls in love with a local man and they begin shacking up together.  He does take business trips, and doesn't seem to be around when the strange things start occurring.  He doesn't believe her visions and tries to help her, but can the strange man somehow be tied into the strange occurrences?

""What noise?""
""The howling.""
""You probably just heard the animal in me.""

John Hough, director of Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, American Gothic, Bad Karma, Escape to Witch Mountain, Return from Witch Mountain, and A Ghost in Monte Carlo, delivers Howling IV: The Original Nightmare.  The storyline for this picture is classic 80s slasher mixed with the werewolf genre.  The special effects are fairly corny and the acting is mediocre.  The cast includes Romy Windsor, Michael Weiss, Antony Hamilton, and Susanne Severeid.

""Your man done brought home the bacon.""

I have started watching this series again since I found every movie is on Netflix.  Werewolves were always my favorite plotline in the horror genre so I always enjoy watching these movies.  I can tell you this series is far from on par with Silver Bullet from this time period.  Overall, this is another Howling movie worth skipping.

Grade: D<>This movie is so boring.  It moves along very slowly until the final ten minutes when it finally becomes interesting and the movie ends in the middle of the action (in a very similar way to Dolly Dearest actually, and I hated that ending a lot too).  I have nothing good to say about this movie.  There was some fun stuff at the end, but it wasn't worth sitting through the other 80 minutes.  If you're a fan of the books, I hear this is the closest to them.  However, I never read the books so I just thought this movie sucked.<>Probably the best sequel.<>I really did not like this 1988 Howling 4 movie because director John Hough was trying to mimic the first Howling movie which it did not come close at all. I guess that is why he called it the ORIGINAL NIGHTMARE! SMH Also, there was only one werewolf which was the king wolf and the rest was normal looking wolves which was shown almost towards the end of the movie. Majority of the movie was dialog. You do not see any transformation like the first Howling. I notice the more Howling movies that was made, the less you see the werewolf!",Harry Alan Towers,,,,R,,,

Vincent offers to continue ""babysitting"" for a fee...

Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""St. Vincent offers the considerable pleasure of seeing Bill Murray back in funny form, but drifts into dangerously sentimental territory along the way."" Richard Roeper gave the film a grade of ""A"", saying Murray's performance could ""mean a Golden Globe"".

This is a classic Bill Murray film in many ways. His excentric character Vincent is right up his alley and makes you think of his most beloved characters back in the early 80s. It´s a solid ensemble cast with Naomi Watts bringing out an intriguing russian accent (!) and for once Melissa McCarthy plays a very downplayed character and she actually don´t ruin the film. The story is not unique in any way based on a kid coming of age, but the storyline comes alive thanks to Mr. Murray and the rest of the cast.<>Every character was well cast and well played. I didn't expect to love this movie, but I did. I thought it might be another silly Bill Murray movie but then I saw, for the first time, what a truly fine actor he really is. Wow. His timing and delivery blow me away. There's not really much of a story. Without this cast, I may not have been moved enough to leave this review. Who says character-driven movies can't be great? Chris O'Dowd never disappoints—never. Jaeden Martell and Dario Barosso prove that talent is something you are born with. How else can you explain how such young actors could be so believable and not pale in the presence of veterans? It's incredible that at 12 years old Jaeden could deliver a performance that grabs the attention of an audience and holds it. Naomi Watts brought dimension to her character beyond mere dialog, and this is one of the best roles I've seen Melissa McCarthy play. St. Vincent is a must-see!<>7 years ago- Bill Murray walking the fine line between dramatic and absolutely nailing it.

There are two things this remake did I actually liked, that the original didn't resolve or even bring up again: 1) It gave justice to Lady after her caregiver, Aunt Sarah (Yvette Brown), practically mistreated her for something she didn't do. 2) Some of the other dogs in the pound were brought back and adopted.

Other than that, the movie has some things I enjoyed, but a good chunk of the time I was rolling my eyes out of annoyance. My biggest issue with the movie? It's just how sappy/corny it felt. I'm glad it wasn't a page-by-page remake like The Lion King and Beauty & the Beast was, but what is it with the writers and directors telling themselves ""Hmm...the original is sweet and had good writing, let's make it extra cutesy and add more dramatic flair it really doesn't need.""

The acting isn't bad by any means, but the human characters are the ones whose actions I question most. There's a reason why an animated character can get away with how voice actors make them sound like, because it adds more flair to something that's exaggerated purposefully. When an actor tries to act and sound like a cartoon in a live action setting, they look awkward or silly, and like they're not taking the role seriously. Their words and actions feel forced.

The rest of the movie is ""fine"" but it overall lacks a serious charm of the original. If anything it just feels like a more toned down version of it, with unnecessary padding.<>F**k this bullsh*t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>Disney should stop with the remakes if they cant keep with the original characters or story line!!

another bad remake<>As far as Disney live action remakes go this one is a mixed bag the special effects/CGI are very well done especially for a Direct to streaming movie on the other hand they cut some of the best scenes from the original like the zoo sequence and the Dog alley fight most changes are definitely for the worse which makes this movie a bit of a disappointment and very underwhelming<>Great dog movie loved every moments about it ,,,the story was so smooth and felt great ,,,special effects and dogs  characters were so real ,,,,, the background music so in harmony with the scenes<>I love it.

EXCEPT, there would not enough force to break his neck with the distance it closed on him and if he was supposed to have strangled, considering he was already out side and the spider was inside, that's his stupidity.   Another girl gets her head slammed through a window, cutting her throat.  EXCEPT, this was obviously a 1960 to 1970s VW Bug.  Which means it would have safety glass which was standard safety since the 1920s.  Plus who the hell is so scared of harmless spiders enough to have a heart attack?

So, the plot was convincing and she was a good actress. There were some unexpected surprises thrown in. If you have a fear of spiders, or have claustrophobia then stay away from this movie. The fear ideally involves people stuck in tight area's with creepy crawlies climbing on them, while they have no place to go.<>Kiss of the Tarantula is one of the more infuriating movies that I've seen recently. Not only does it have a needless and leisurely pace, but it also doesn't have anything resembling an actual horror movie. This barely qualifies as a movie that's so bad that it's good, and even so, I don't think I could recommend it to anyone for that purpose. It just drags on most of the time and makes you want to shut it off. None of the characters are appealing, the deaths are laughable, and the movie just looks terrible, in general. This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and not in an enjoyable fashion. I was glad when it was over, that's for sure.

It's silly as hell, but still amusing.

Rental.<>Kiss of the Tarantula (Chris Munger, 1976)

I'm not quite sure how to review this incoherent mess of a movie, since most of what I was thinking while watching it had to do with speculation about the altered states of everyone involved with this movie-from the writers of the spec to the distributors who actually released it. (""Actually"" as in ""you actually sent this to a movie theater and expected them to show it?"".) I certainly couldn't concentrate on the plot, which pops in and says hello every once in a while before going back to cower in its hole. Or the acting (only one cast member, Scream, Blacula, Scream!'s Eric Mason, had a career in Hollywood after this movie; he never worked in features again, only television). Or the direction. Or anything else, really. I don't think I've ever described a movie as ""goofy"" before, but I can't think of another term that fits here.

The plot concerns Susan Bradley (Suzanna Ling), a disturbed teenager who really, really likes spiders. It's your basic revenge drama (think I Spit on Your Grave, or perhaps more on point Willard), teen thugs break into her house and kill one of her spiders, and she sets the others on them. But it's structured almost like a porn film-once we get to the revenge bit, there are long, drawn-out episodes that have very little scene-building before we get down to business. Except in this case, the business has not to do with naked bodies but crawling spiders.

To be fair, I have seen worse movies over the past week, but that doesn't mean it's worth your time. Bloody awful. *  1/2<>At the end she wraps The Guy plastic so he suffocates and she closes the lid of a 20 gauge casket upon him so he dies a horrible death.

Their movies are not great by any means, but typically you find them very watchable and very occasionally even better than the blockbuster counterpart. In the case of Hillside Cannibals, a copy of The Hills Have Eyes, this is very untrue.

In fact this may be the worse film I have ever seen in my life.

In no way did I enjoy this film. In no way did I ever believe that the director or actors gave one little bit of a care that they where creating a film in order to entertain others. With this movie, I honestly began to wonder if Asylum was just a front for some sort of organized crime, laundering money through abominations such as this.

Within moments of the movie starting,t he cast irritated me to complete heights I had not been irritated to before. A cast that appear to be in their mid 20?s playing teenagers. A member of the group asking if someone had remembered the weed, after HOURS of driving to get to a remote location. Seriously? You waited that long to ask a question like that?

The only time I got close to finding a miniscule of enjoyment, was when three of the absolutely annoying people where killed in like 5 minutes of the movie beginning by some of the worst looking ""hill people"" I have ever seen. Every attempt at trying to deliver something good, the movie failed. The gore was crap, the murders unimaginative, everything just horrible.

I've heard the DVD has some great special features on how to do gore and graphics, and that these features are the only reason to ever buy or rent this movie. That is the only reason I'm attaching my usual Amazon.com buy link, in case you want to check that out.

Otherwise, stay far far away from this movie.

It is upbeat in the first half but not entirely. It's a sobering family drama about freedom - personal freedom and Chinese cultural expectations, I suppose. It's a bit slow, plot wise, mid-way through and may bore some but I thought it's reasonably good.

The three acts all have amazing things about them, though I think the second works the best, the transitions are smooth, detailed and carry on from each other excellently well. I hadn't seen a Jia film before this one and his original directing style made me want to watch as much of him as possible. It doesn't always pay off but he's insistent on doing something different that other films, especially of this type do not. While still good, the first act made me think the film was going to be a enjoyable if not a bit mildly diverting but Jia follows the film through with such originality and flair it makes it work as a whole. Capitalism is rife in Chinese society which poses a dangerous precedent of westernisation, loneliness and lack of identity which the film comments on terrifically. The whole thing is filmed beautifully and written well with a few hiccups. This is a fantastically new, thought provoking film that while it doesn't always work I appreciate Jia's attempt at originality and respect him and this film far more than a few others I've liked equally as much. <>The structure is great, the emotions are rich, but the third act unravels my prior impression and that's a shame. It's always better to have a bad film with a mindblowing ending than the reverse of that.<>The modernisation was of good effect. The story otherwise did not work for me. Terrible.<>A disjointed, cheesy and poorly-acted film that constantly shifts focus between characters (even abandoning them for no reason), with arbitrary leaps in time that make everything seem too superficial and unimportant to work as a look at the lives of common people.<>Thoughtful and well acted drama on regrets and decisions in life.<>A bunch of 40 year olds trying to act like teenagers. Then '20 years later' they have exact same look, but now more realistic to their real age. Enough said. The direction sucks with so many useless shots. The actress got the lead probably because she's filthy rich but can't act to save her life.  I really tried for 40 minutes and was just too much. Not sure why so many good reviews.. don't believe me? Go watch it yourself.<>Mountains May Depart es un vistazo a la naturaleza de las emociones y a las historias que puede generar una vida. Para quienes están acostumbrados al cine occidental, este filme confirma la universalidad de los sentimientos.
La estructura de la película resulta bastante interesante. Basta con señalar que la presentación principal del título ocurre casi una hora después de que el filme ha iniciado. Esto pareciera dejar en claro que la primera parte se trata simplemente de una introducción y no representa necesariamente la esencia de la película; un buen pretexto para los grandes saltos que da la historia durante los primeros minutos, así como la rapidez con la que se desarrollan determinadas situaciones. A partir de este punto, la cinta se torna más lenta y profunda, involucrando no sólo sentimientos románticos, sino también demás elementos y emociones que aportan mayor diversidad al relato. Esta diversidad es tan amplia que en ocasiones pareciera que se trata de distintas películas que se encuentran ligeramente conectadas y que alternan el rol protagonista de los personajes.
Se trata de una historia sentimental y reflexiva que recorre distintos aspectos de las emociones humanas, apoyándose en un interesante entorno y elementos propios del país en el que se desarrolla, lo que permite contar con un filme que no sólo funciona como un reflejo de las características humanas, sino también como un pequeño retrato de la cultura china y los elementos que la conforman.
A pesar de las buenas intenciones del director y la reflexión que busca generar, Mountains May Depart puede resultar vaga y poco interesante por momentos, recorriendo un camino que pareciera no tener un rumbo totalmente definido y restándole solidez a la cinta en general. El resultado de esta situación es una película con elementos destacables pero que se aleja de ser completamente disfrutable.<>Lots of pregnant pauses. Dug the directorial style, but no idea what really happened in that third act. Was that supposed to be the same dog? Was Liangzi still good? Great insight into Chinese culture, as was recommended to me.<>Like a changing urban landscape, the humans as well!

When everybody around me liked the director's previous film 'A Touch of Sin', I didn't. As a film fanatic, reject such kind of film is not an easy job without giving a proper reason. I thought that was a missed opportunity. I surely like art films, not the boring one like those aimlessly narrated. I really loved some of the scenes there, but here it was completely different. Most importantly, anybody would understand what the film is trying to say without trying too hard.

This is a theme where the China's rise was revealed from the three people's personal life perspective that was categorised to the three generations or the timelines. That's not it, the communism was also highlighted, how it held back the people's freedom. The writer was really smart to smoothly disclosing that to the world. I mean the film never dragged the China's ruling party or its system, but all were told from its character who struggled and if you use your brain, you will get it why.

The narration was divided into three episodes. The first one takes place in the year 1999, in a small town somewhere in the China which is economically backward. The story follows a young woman named Tao, who is caught in a love triangle. But for the practical reason, she has to choose one of them and when she does, the other guy leaves the town with the heartbroken. This is the foundation, that dragged for nearly 40 minutes. Obviously slow, but very realistic approach.

I grew up in the 90s, my country was not much different than what's in this film was shown. So I liked the atmosphere, all those the 90s set, the automobiles, lifestyle, the landscapes of the small towns et cetera taken me back to that time. But the thing is, it was China, society and culturally different. Anyway, it was past and what follows are totally flips the narration, including the perspective.

""You know the hardest thing, about love is caring.""

The second episode takes place in the year 2014, which is something like the present. It reveals what's the status of all the main three characters, like where they're economically standing and the personal life struggles. Tao's married life did not go well and her son is around ten years old who visits her from Shanghai. The one who left the town is now returned and battling for his life for some reason.

In the last 15 years, the China significantly changed and still, this entire part is set in the same town which is now economically moved forward. Like the changing urban landscape, how these characters too changed were what focused on this section.

Then comes the final episode where it is now in the year 2025, that takes place somewhere in the Australia. The perspective was changed, the little boy is now in his 20s, seems lost is root. With his behaviour, you would notice that his lack of knowledge about his ancestors. He who has the differences with his father, decides to make his life as he wanted. That is why the parents should take responsibility to teach their children all the good things about their culture and traditions, and to carry on, it's up to them. Because losing one's identity could lead to the failures in the life.

This is the part I liked better. Because it was something like what I encountered in my life. Most of the childhood memories that returns after we're grown-up as the deja vu, like the history repeating itself. Here for pointing out the freedom one to buy a gun was indirectly hit the communism. I mean gun was not a threat, it was just an expressed how it affects people in all the similar circumstances. I meant, what something was hidden brings more eagerness for us to know about it than those are in the out. So forcing something on people is sometime is a bad idea.

All the actors were good, but apart from the slow screenplay, I liked the idea of this film. There are some other similar films, like how different generations behave and now this is among them, yet not the best out of all of them. Very much watchable, only if you are capable of handling slow drag. If you know this director very well or the fan of his works, you will find it a pretty interesting film. I won't recommend it, but I also won't either suggest you to skip it.

I didn't buy the whole idea of Edison Chen meeting this girl and then having a love relationship with her coz when he first meets her, it's more of an older brother relationship. Really poorly handled. I guess some of the violence is entertaining. They have some really creative deaths here. People who love blood and gore should like this.

The assassin befriends an abused homeless woman and they go on the run, and the movie derails itself with sappy songs and a strange finale.

We see old family footage of Hutz in the Ukraine, of the early days of the band in the old Bulgaria Bar to the current travels of the band around the world. Though the band has gotten some above ground attention as of late and certainly play bigger venues these days, Hutz and the others have not abandoned their ties to the bohemian underground (the international squatter symbol is prominently sprayed onto the wall of more than one building they visit in different locales.)

What is annoying here is that said analysis nee deconstruction is the mask of what's really going on.  Underneath that facade, Paul H-O reveals himself as a bitter/ depressed ex-boyfriend who wants the viewer to feel sorry for him as he is ""done wrong"" by the big, bad art world, too elitist and hostile to recognize his own talent, and his ex-girlfriend, Cindy Sherman.  Billed as a ""quirky valentine"" to Cindy Sherman, it really amounts to a rant against her and his jealousy of her success.<>Interesting glimpse into the world of high dollar ""art"". Makes the music biz look comparatively benign.<>incredible! crudely shot & edited but fascinating story<>Started off interesting, took a long time to get to the point, became overly self-indulgent. I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?<>Mediocre documentary concerning local public access show host, Paul H-O and the unlikely relationship with artist Cindy Sherman.  While Paul protests that he's not a trophy wife, the ""talentless guy you would prefer to avoid"" only proves he's no trophy of any kind.  During his day of hosting the public access show Gallery Beat, Paul was critical of art losing its' meaning and evolving into an outlet for rich art addicts to get their fix on overrated, overpriced auction items.  This would only prove art in the 90's sucked and only served to boost egos of dominating males in the industry.

The very interesting bits were, of course, insight to Cindy Sherman and seeing the behind the scenes look at her own work, while Paul would reap the benefits of going from the D-list to the guest of an A-lister and losing sight of himself as the street critic armed with a camera and microphone. We would soon see Paul comparing the cost of new shoes (paid for by Cindy Sherman) with other A-listers.  This is such pathetic self-loathing and seriously doubt anyone would feel bad for Paul after the inevitable break-up.  

My advice is to do what your parents did; get a job, sir.

I advise people to watch this, along with its sequel.<>Masterpiece. The most underrated film ever. Can't believe the critics disagree with me. Hood classic<>It's an alright film. Obviously, it's for kids, so the content is certainly not high quality, but if you know what you're getting into, it's just fine. Plenty of references that are genuinely amusing. There were some scenes that were a little boring to me, so I just skipped over them.<>I really like this film so I just like it<>A funny and touching movie that tells the story of an outcast bird because of his anger problems and his thick eyebrows. At the end, he saves the day when he recognises that pig visitors  stole the eggs from their houses while the parents were in a party that the pigs organized to distract them.
The movie takes place in Bird Island, an untouched paradise inhabited by naive and innocent birds.<>So angry birds is a game where you basically slingshot a bird into Structures like buildings, crates, cages and a bunch of pigs, there isn't much for a story, but behold, they actually made an entire movie out of it and gave a very good depth to all the characters, and even though it's an animated movie I actually think they did very well, because let's face it, the game isn't a dark game, it's not serious at all, the game is very light hearted, bright and colourful and I think the transition from game to film is actually seemless and actually give the game characters much more character. 

So it has been a while since I watched this movie, first I have got to say, I really like the story and I don't remember so much jokes that will go over kids heads, bird control? Like what the heck! This is one of those movies that was also over marketed, they just showed way too much before the movie came out so alot of the funniest scenes was already shown trailers. What really made me root for the character was that no one was in his side and it was obvious about the pigs, the entire ending if them sling shorting them selves was actually like the game, and even though that's the only part in the movie where they do that, the rest of the movie was still entertaining and extremely hilarious, and they gave real good solid ending. 

So the animation in this movie is good, it's a little different than what I'm use to, it's almost like Secret life of pets but it's animation feels heavy, the colours is very solid especially if you watching in itsy highest resolution, but what is far more impressive is the sound, not just the sound effects but the music, that was absolutely perfect and give the movie a feel good vibe. All the music fit the scenes perfectly infact it made then more enjoyable, and I cannot believe they had Rick Astley never gonna give you up in a scene and it actually did fit perfectly. The story had alot of character development and had some very emotional moments with the main character, which actually did justice for the characters in the game. I think this movie did very well to represent the game.<>So bad it's good

With her criminal husband (Robert Joy) on her trail, however, it appears that she can't escape from trouble, until she finds an unlikely savior in Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster), an aging small-time mobster. By becoming involved with Sally, Lou finds a way to achieve the success he's dreamed of, but his plan may endanger both their lives.","Burt Lancaster, Susan Sarandon, Kate Reid, Michel Piccoli, Hollis McLaren, Robert Joy, Al Waxman, Robert Goulet, Moses Znaimer, Angus MacInnes, Sean Sullivan, Wallace Shawn, Harvey Atkin, Louis Del Grande, John McCurry, Eleanor Beecroft, Cec Linder, Sean McCann, Vincent Glorioso, Louis Malle, Denis Héroux, Gabriel Boustani, Justine Heroux, Jean-Claude Laureux, Richard Ciupka, Michel Legrand, Jacques Maumont, John Guare, Suzanne Baron, Anne Pritchard","Lancaster was never more moving onscreen than when he was lying to himself, and there are shades of his shattering performance as John Cheever’s 'The Swimmer' in Lou’s tall tales of his glory days. <>Atlantic City is a rough and tender film, a dreamer's film, and beautifully made. A small film that plays for high stakes and ends with the wheel still rolling.<>The bleak cinematography and subtle score give Atlantic City a hypnotic quality and it obviously inspired Bruce Springsteen's track of the same name from his Nebraska album - in fact lines from the song are ""borrowed"" from Guare's screenplay.<>Louis Malle's graceful, heartrending look at love and loss on the boardwalk remains as vibrant as ever four decades on.<>Atlantic City references the action genre only to dismantle it from the inside... With feeling and exuberance, Louis Malle constructs a spectacle. [Full Review in Spanish]<>It combines French discipline and nonchalance with an American generosity and high spirits. The dialogue is precise and often witty, qualities it shares with the acting.<>It abounds in heroics, glories in coincidence, indulges in sentiment, laughs at Cupid's bizarre sense of humor and provides sumptuous parts for the five leading players, who know how to seize their opportunities.<>""Atlantic City"" is full of compact social editorializing that elevates its seemingly run-of-the-mill trappings into something sublime by way of its emotionally dependent characters.<>[Sarandon is] shirtless before she even has a name, but her desire to be ogled is granted dignity and power; gradually and unassumingly, she upstages a terrific Burt Lancaster.<>A shimmering success.<>""Atlantic City"" is a sophisticated fairy tale, beautifully acted and beautiful to behold; it is as funny as it is touching.<>A well observed and deeply tender tale.<>Film is blessed with a spare, intriguing script by Yank John Guare, which always skirts impending cliches and predictability by finding unusual facets in his characters and their actions.<><>Eclectic, pacy and hard to categorise, it's part crime thriller, part love story, part fairytale, and part a gentle, generous examination of certain dying aspects of American culture.<>This lyrical tale set in Atlantic City in times of change is full of offbeat characters. It is evocatively directed by Louis Malle in his second (and better) American film and well acted by Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon as the odd romantic couple.<>What makes ""Atlantic City"" sweet -- and that's the word for it -- is the gentleness with which Lou handles his last chance at amounting to something, and the wisdom with which Sally handles Lou.<>Intriguing from beginning to end.<>If you don't already love Sarandon, this is the feature that would do it. Director and the 2 stars mesh their talents beautifully.<>Poignant, atmospheric mood piece with pristine performances by Lancaster and Sarandon.","Louis Malle's Atlantic City is a dreamy, lyrical and beautiful film made in a gritty, ugly city that is caught between its faded former glory and the promise of renewal and rebirth, thanks to casinos, themselves ugly and corrupting.  It's about two people at opposite ends of their lives who cross paths for a few magical days.  Burt Lancaster is marvelous as a former underworld errand-boy who still dreams of doing great things.  Susan Sarandon is outstanding as a young woman running from a desolate youth in the Canadian prairie and a bad marriage.  She's also been cheated by those closest to her.  The story and Malle's direction reflect a deep humanity and a tremendous eye for portraying characters through small gestures and production details.  Never has such a squalid society been portrayed with such love.<>""Just let the boys see how well I turned out.""

The 'older character trapped in a prison of nostalgia' is not a particularly innovative archetype; it's been a cinematic mainstay ever since Norma Desmond announced that she was ""ready for her close-up"". As a setting, Atlantic City seems a particularly apt selection for a story based around such a character - a once-decadent city now in steep decline with its glory days well behind it. And while that base design may have served as the inspiration for Lancaster's character Lou, Atlantic City adds in a surprising amount of variety and flavor to go beyond broad-stroke plot development. 

An elderly Lou fancies himself a product of the glory days of American gambling, rubbing shoulders with big name gangsters when in reality he is simply a former small fry now self-aggrandizing in his old age. When by sheer coincidence he lucks into a windfall, he treats it as the opportunity to live out his fantasy, ordering new clothes, the best food, and pursuing a woman that he fantasizes about through his window, Sarandon's Sally. The film gets great when the house of cards comes crumbling down, as Susan is fired from her job (trying to pursue her own fantasy - a dealer in Monte Carlo where only men are allowed the position) and realizes that it was her husband's stolen drugs that were responsible for Lou's gifts. Her entire countenance immediately changes, from the porcelain doll that Lou wanted to play with to a practical ruthlessness, capped by a ruse in which she convinces a bus driver that Lou is her dementia-riddled father, concocting a convincing backstory on the spot. 

It's not just the toxic nostalgia, it's the mix of a few key elements that makes Atlantic City a convincing story - the obsession with the past, the self-deception, and the realization of impotence and unfulfilled ambiton. The supporting cast is good (including a Robert Goulet cameo and a woman who doesn't use seatbelts because she doesn't believe in gravity), but the two leads are both great; Lancaster demonstrates that he's still got particualr range as he becomes awash in giddiness at gunning down a couple of mobsters and seeing his police sketch on TV, excited to tell the whole world that he finally did something real. (3.5/5)<>A film that starts slow but becomes engrossing when the down-trodden characters are in danger and lose what little they have. Lancaster and Sarandon's character's have similar parallels as both are trying to get by with what little they have while reluctantly helping their friend and family respectively. Both actors play there roles well and the script is also well-written to gradually reveal each character's history and keep the audience engaged. It may not be well-told as  Malle's Au Revoir, Les Enfants but it is still an entertaining film. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the 54th Academy Awards. The only nominee I have seen is Raiders of the Lost Ark which I thought was better than this film. I also thought Spielberg directed Raiders better than this film. I haven't seen Lancaster's other Best Actor nominees. I only other nominee I saw in Sarandon's category, Best Actress, was Meryl Streep who I thought acted as well as Sarandon and I wouldn't mind which actress won.<>Mr and Mrs Blobbo saw in theater at time. Duel reaction - Meh.
Update --- 40 years later movie plays better.  (Maybe because Blobbo older.)<>A poem about the dreams of youth and a last shot at grabbing them, ""Atlantic City"" can't help but capture your heart. Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon come together as two unlikely heroes who save each other in lovely, surprising ways. Lancaster, an aging two-bit criminal, carries himself with just enough panache to score nubile Sarandon and the great mob hit he always dreamed of. Nice to see an older guy played, not with a halting gait, but big brass balls and a swagger.<>Initially I remember thinking, that's a better looking older man-I bet he was something back in his day lol before I realized it was Burt Lancaster and this was a metaphor in the film. its about a guy goin thru a sorta end of life crisis , reliving his younger days and pretending he was more of a big shot in life.  His life gets entangled with a younger, pretty woman who represents his youth to him and what he couldn't obtain. Living as next-door neighbors he gets involved w/ a drug deal gone awry w/ her ex husband. Its his last big hurrah at regaining his long gone youth. Its def a diff n sorta refreshing take on a crime film and the setting is near perfect for the film premise.  I found it enjoyable/interesting to watch altho not exactly a film that leaves u fuzzy inside, altho I was longing for the beach. The main acting was good and the plot was great.<>Awesome cast and portraits makes the movie unforgettable.<>Superb little movie. Burt Lancaster, even at the end of his career, give a wonderful, fully rounded performance. There is a huge Canadian presence as many, if not most of the supporting cast, from Kate Reid on down are familiar to Canadians from film TV shows and even commercials.<>How this gets such high ratings is beyond me. A fairly boring movie, in an ugly place, an ugly time, with unappealing characters.

A classic in our book!<>hey, Roy, how you doin?<>Excellent movie , grand action, story, soundtrack, acting.<>Enjoyed the long sequences of the scenery. Made me feel like I was outside. Brutal, but likeable. Oh, and I loved Laura San Giacomo. She was one tough cookie.<>A badly underrated ""western"" that plays in Australia. Tom Selleck, although James Stewart or Gregory Peck he ain't, surpasses his routine TV image by playing a quintessentially good and righteous American rifleman who is appalled when he finds out that the vermin he has been hired to kill turn out to be human beings – Aboriginals, for that matter. The film has its downsides – Quigley possesses superhuman strength and endurance, and Laura San Giacomo's part beggars belief – but it has its heart in the right place with its denouncement of brutal racism against the original Australian population. I would say there is some realism, too: for once the hero does not shoot ten bad guys with one revolver from a mile's distance without reloading, but he uses a highly sophisticated and very powerful rifle. Alan Rickman obviously enjoys playing the caricatural villain (one critic wrote: ""he's in full sneering mode"").<>One of the most underrated funny westerns I have ever seen.<>Considering Tom Selleck was going to be Indiana Jones and I thought this might be a similar type of movie I wanted to check it out.  The movie wasn't terrible but really would have been better if it was more of an adventure and less of a white hat/black hat stand off.  I also thought the movie seemed rather slow.  Tom Selleck doesn't really convince me he was from the old American west, but it wasn't a bad performance, and if he played it up it could have been much worse.

I grew up with Winnie the Pooh watching the various episodes even the classic 1970s film 
I remember having this vhs and watching it endlessly 
It hit close to my heart with its larger story and simple emotions not just the animation and memorable characters 
Critics to my shock didn't really like it when it came out which I think is kinda unfair, this is severely underrated in many respects 
Winnie the Pooh and his best friend Christopher Robin enjoy their time together as they usually do but one day he tells Pooh Bear he may not be around forever 
Pooh falls asleep into the next day when autumn starts and finds a honey pot outside his home unaware that a note is attached 
The note says Christopher Robin is at school but everyone else including Pooh doesn't know that; after a misunderstood translation from Owl Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet, Tigger, and Eeyore set out to find him 
They think he's trapped at Skull and in mortal danger 
So the film has our animal friends venture beyond the Hundred Acre Wood while in the process learn something about themselves being brave, smart, strong etc. 
The film isn't perfect; after all it is only over an hour and 19 min long 
It's got really good songs though and very deep lines 
Some funny slapstick to go with 
The art style matches the books from way back 
The payoff really overshadows everything yet it's one of the better Winnie the Pooh flicks  despite some manipulative ness 
A bit heavy handed at the beginning but the imagination is handled very well 
The biggest adventures seem like the smallest ones and one friend can't exist without the each other in their lives 
We will always be with one another no matter what or no matter when 
Solidly animated, short, harmless, and children and parents will adore it from beginning to end 
Winnie the Pooh is still so timeless to this day and this movie touches on the psychological as well as imaginative aspects we can all grasp onto 
Lots of simple delights and unexpected charm<>Funny and original, LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>If I had to say something about Poohs Grand Adventure all I have to say it's the most perfect and the best straight to home video film ever made.  This film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation is my most revered and treasured film I grew up with.  The animation is beautiful the artwork is stunning and there was a lot of effort care and creativity that got poured into this film.  The best part is there isn't any forced or phoned in messages like other films and there no additional filler needed to make the film more quirky.  I'm shocked that it didn't get released in theaters. Everything was done perfect in this film but hit home is  the songs especially Wherever you Are wow that hits me every time I hear it.  It's the best straight to home video to watch.<>It's fun, and has the heart of a Winnie the Pooh adventure you'd look for.<>This movie was created by the television division of Walt Disney Animation and is the series finale of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. In this film the 100 acre wood characters are looking for Christopher Robin and must overcome their insecurities along the way. Like the television show, there are things missing in this movie, such as the interactions with the narrator and words in the book. Kanga and Roo are also not present and I did miss them. The target demographic is younger than the 1977 film and there is less humor for adults. There is also no suspense as the audience knows where Christopher Robin is the whole time. There are a few Pooh-isms and a few giggles to be had. If you enjoyed the television cartoon or Pooh in general, this might be worth checking out.<>Pooh's Grand Adventure isn't anything like The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. But it seems to do fine. It's just a simple story of Pooh and his friends searching for Christopher Robin as they enter the terror outside of the Hundred Acre Wood. It may seem tedious to adults knowing everything is a bit predictable and nothing is really that scary to the audience, but there's a lot of charm put into the film. There's still some really good songs that don't feel like a way to interrupt the running time and even has some funny scenes. The animation is also above a standard level unlike some of the terrible Disney sequels. I think it's a good movie for direct-to-video, just don't compare it to The Many Adventures and you won't be disappointed.<>Loved this movie as a kid,so many great songs and I liked the darker themes in it,it made the film more engaging and less pointlessly kiddy",Karl Geurs,,,,,,,

When a friend of Lady Jane Ainsley (Frieda Inescort) becomes Tesla's next victim, Jane and an acquaintance stalk the vampire and kill him by driving a stake through his heart. But 23 years later, a German bomb disturbs Tesla's grave, and cemetery workers restoring the site pull the stake from his corpse, bringing him back to life to seek revenge.","Bela Lugosi, Frieda Inescort, Nina Foch, Roland Varno, Miles Mander, Matt Willis, Lew Landers, Kurt Neumann","[Bela Lugosi] marvelously embodies the sinister character. [Full review in Spanish]<>But Legosi is the primary reason to give the film a look, and his playfully lithe performance is an utter delight.<>Lugosi's fine tackling a variation of his signature role -- even if he was already starting to look frail at this point in his career -- and the wartime setting adds some interesting elements.<>Set during WWII, the film tries to combine wartime propaganda and horror.<>One of Bela Lugosi's better later day roles since he played Dracula in the 1930s for Universal.<><>A straightforward -- almost by-the-numbers -- vampire movie, and one that stays on something like a high school level of horror, but with a strong Lugosi performance.<>","This isn't an official sequel to the 1931 Universal Studios film Dracula but it really feels like it, except that Lugosi's name is Armand Tesla and this is made by Columbia. This would be the actor's last major studio movie.

Lady Jane Ainsley (Frieda Inescort) is stalked by Tesla twice, once during the first World War and again during the second. The first time they crossed paths, she ended up staking him and freeing Andréas, a werewolf, from his curse. He becomes her assistant and his makeup would go on to be used again in 1956's The Werewolf.

Twenty four years later, during the blitz, some cemetery workers find the body of Tesla and remove the stake from his heart, thinking that it's shrapnel. Now Tesla walks the Earth again, with Andréas back in thrall, taking the name of Hugo Bruckner, a scientist who has escaped from a concentration camp and is coming to work with Ainsley. Meanwhile, Sir Fredrick Fleet of Scotland Yard believes that Ainsley is a murderer and that there's no way there can be a vampire.

Director Lew Landers also made 175 other movies, with probably The Raven being his best-known film.

It's pretty wild that Columbia did everything they could to make their own Dracula movie. Universal did threaten to sue, as they had the Lon Chaney Jr.-starring Son of Dracula coming out. If you think you may have seen this before, it is the movie playing in Iron Maiden's video for ""Number of the Beast.""<>Passable, but not the best of the vampire genre.<>WWII used as backdrop<>When a vampire's body is unearthed by a bombing raid on London during WWII, his stake is removed and he rises from the dead. With the help of his werewolf henchman, seeks revenge on the woman who staked him two decades earlier.  Since Universal owned the rights to the Dracula franchise, Columbia had to make several changes to the story. The fact that the movie takes place in contemporary England, and that the vampire's assistant is a werewolf, are the only new twists in this movie, which in all other respects is a typical vampire movie from the golden age of monsters.

Bela Lugosi delivers his lines with his usual flair. Althought he only played a vampire two other times on film - in the original Dracula and in the Abbott and Costello movie - he slips smoothly into the role he made famous.  Nina Foch, cast as the requisite damsel in distress, is the only other actor of note and she does a credible job.  The rest of the cast was nondescript, at best.

Though I wouldn't call it a great movie it features a strong performance by Bela Lugosi and plenty of gothic atmosphere in the form of foggy graveyards and decaying crypts to make the film a more than passable example of the genre.<>One of Bela Lugosi's better later day roles since he played Dracula in the 1930s, as he once again plays a vampire but this time with a different name (for legal reasons) for Columbia instead of Universal. It's an old-fashioned vampire story (whose time has come and gone) that's set in contemporary England during the London blitz, and plays out as your typical vampire movie (except for the modern setting). It's visually satisfying and well-acted, but too verbose and without a sense of humor. Lifelessly directed by Lew Landers and unimaginatively written by Randall Faye and Griffin Jay, but what helps is Bela Lugosi playing what he does best--a vampire.<>columbia's version of 'dracula'<>Bela Lugosi great , but talking man wolf ruins the movie,if u ask me i think Dracula shuld'a popped a (silver )cap in his ass<>Absolutely wonderful 40s horror romp with Lugosi giving one of his best performances of the decade (only in ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN and possibly THE DEVIL BAT was he better in the 40s). Matt Willis is a great, shaggy werewolf.<>And better than The Hunger.<>So exactly HOW many times has Lugosi been cast as a vampire?",,,,,,,,

Loosely based on the novel by Emily Bronte.,"Fabienne Babe, Lucas Belvaux, Olivier Cruveiller, Alice de Poncheville, Sandra Montaigu, Olivier Torres, Jacques Rivette",The most puzzling of all the film versions of Wuthering Heights.<>This is more than just Celine and Julie Go Boating's haunted house melodrama played straight.,"This is quite a morose versions of Withering Heights but it is riveting, well acted, and all the people are beautiful though it doesn't help them much.<>The actors  performances were the worst I have ever seen. They were so over dramatic, too precise, and too stale, there was no heart into any of them. Every movement looked forced. The only performance I did enjoy was Olivier Cruveiller's. His wasn't so over dramatic or mannequin. Olivier Torres' played the part too wimpy and I don't think Oliver or as Emily Bronte calls him Edgar Linton was ever that wimpy. Also, this film didn't follow as closely to the book as I've seen other versions do. In other words, catch the 1992 or 1998 versions, they are overall better versions.

www.what-to-watch.com<>It is always hard to judge a modern-time adaptation of a historically-set novel one knows all too well. âWuthering Heightsâ by Emily BrontÃ« has always been one of my favourite novels, and âHurleventâ (1985) by Jacques Rivette is one of the many (film) adaptations that have seen the light of day since the publication of the original (1847). This makes the viewing experience a special one, namely one of trying to compare all the details of both versions. Rivette stuck to the original in many respects. He changed a few names that do no work too well in French, I presume (like Roch instead of Heathcliff, Olivier instead of Edgar, and Guillaume instead of Hindley). Most other names were kept (close to) original. The historical setting has been changed from the late eighteenth-early nineteenth century to what I think is supposed to be the 1920s or possibly early 1930s. The only elements that give away the historical period is the fashionable clothing of the Lindon family and their pastimes (including gramophone records being played). The rural environment itself makes one think the clocks have stopped and never moved forward again: as far as I can remember, there arenâ(TM)t even any motorized vehicles on the farm (which perhaps wasnâ(TM)t usual in pre-war Western Europe). This provides the story with a timeless quality I never realized it had. Since the film lasts long enough anyway (130 minutes), the makers decided to stick to the first section of the novel only (forgetting about the next generations) to avoid unnecessary complications, which is good. As far as the acting is concerned, this was very good too, which cannot always be said of the typecasting: Heathcliff/Roch is way too blond and unmysterious: at first I thought Guillaume was Roch. His darkhaired, moody and passionate nature would have been much more befitting for Roch. I wasnâ(TM)t too happy about Catherine either: she is a plain, nondescript girl who doesnâ(TM)t seem the passionate type (although she plays it accurately enough). One does not particularly take to her, which is an opportunity missed. Whatâ(TM)s more, she looks far too 1980s (possibly because of the sexless, boyish haircut). The other characters (like HÃ (C)lÃ¨ne, the servant, and Isabella and her brother) are OK, although Josephâ(TM)s bible babble doesnâ(TM)t seem to serve any particular purpose in this adaptation. âHurleventâ is an adequate attempt to honour a legendary novel, but it doesnâ(TM)t score in all departments. I found it bearable, but no more than that.<>This film was easily one of my favourites of Rivette's films. An amazing display of emotional turmoil where love is one endless toil and misery for everyone involved. Involvement is the underlying fuse, the cartridge is the people and the action, the revenge and the agony, all one potent mixture for mankind's withering. A starkly simple film with little in the way of mise-en-scene except in subtle varieties of light and colour that smoothens out the texture of this film.<>At worst, the movie was passable. But if it were my introduction to Rivette's work, I would not be tempted to seek out other films by him.<>Remember watching this at school found it quite interesting",,,,,,,,

Uchu daikaijû Girara (The X from Outer Space) (Big Space Monster Guilala),,19,1 Reviews,100+ Ratings,,spilled,,,Kazui Nihonmatsu,,,,,"Peggy Neal, Toshiya Wazaki, Eiji Okada, Itoko Harada, Kazui Nihonmatsu",Cheesy .... .,"Original Japanese Version

The first of four movies released during studio Shochiku's brief stint with horror movies back in the 60s, The X from Outer Space has the reputation of being one of the silliest kaiju films of the era. Despite the constant optimism of its story, what the final product ends up being is so incredibly average yet distinctly unique, that it was hard to pin down a score.

When a crew of scientists returns from Mars with a sample of the space spores that contaminated their ship, they inadvertently bring about a nightmarish earth invasion. After one of the spores is analyzed in a lab, it escapes, eventually growing into an enormous, rampaging beaked beast.

One of only two films directed by Kazui Nihonmatsu, the other being the later released Genocide, it's a whole big bag of fine, not looking out of place with similar budgeted kaiju results at the time. It lacks a certain amount of energy or suspense to it being mostly flat and unadventurous with its techniques.

The film is such a slow-moving slog for its first two acts, following a group of one-note characters as they explore space for long periods of time with seemingly noting note-worthy happening. Then suddenly just as terminal boredom kicks in, the movie suddenly remembers it has something to do and the titular X arrives onscreen as a giant chicken-like kaiju called Guilala.

The special effects by Hiroshi Ikeda are certainly charming, carrying those early Tsuburaya vibes. There are some front projection techniques that don't actually work very well sprinkled in here as Guilala tramples people to death or appears in the distance. Outside of those, however, what is on display is genuinely great filmmaking in spite of its shortcomings. The tiny toy tanks, the beautifully awful little miniature buildings, the planes on string and suitmation are just such a pleasing sight, reminding me of why I originally got into these films in the first place. But dear lord, there's jaw-dropping and vaguely pornographic dispatching of Guilala at the end which is more than gonna scar a few people watching.

The cast doesn't really do anything throughout this film that is particularly praiseworthy, they just kind of skulk around not doing much and simply discuss their situation at hand. There's some decent attempt at an occasionally comedic moment but other than that they are your stock archetypes for this genre who are seemingly acted well enough that they would think you could be watching a better movie.

The music by composer Taku Izumi is certainly distinct, perhaps due to his background in anime compositions. There's definitely an air of psychedelics to the score with its early synth-laden jazz populating most of the runtime. An unpredictable mishmash of 1960s pop and bossa nova. Not really one for my tastes personally but it does the job well enough.

Cheesy and rich in comic non-sequiturs, The X from Outer Space does at least pass for entertainment in the right mindset but is probably best saved for one of those evenings where you and some friends just want to take the piss out of a bad movie. Offering a substantial amount of entertainment value and unintentional humour, thanks to its dual menaces of a gloppy space entity and a rampaging chicken monster.

If you ever decide you want to watch The X from Outer Space, do yourself a favour, and watch the opening credits for the bouncy theme song which you will NEVER get out of your head. Then fast forward to Guilala's first appearance, just brace yourself for Peggy Neal's inane ""What I learned from the monster"" speech at the end.<>Japanese SCI-FI the cheap way. It's probably 2001 lightyears away from Kubricks 2001 in quality. They even dubbed the american actors into japanese.<>The giant chicken monster is NOT our friend--The ""Pushing Tin"" of Japanese monster films... Ridiculously hammy fun!!<>A space romp turned kaiju attack that's as much a cheesy horror story as it is a cultural artifact. Back in the day, giant monsters weren't to be hunted down on their home planet - they were to be rocketed into space to become someone else's problem! Now pass the sake, the hot tub's still bubbling in the jazz-powered shuttle.<>A 1968 movie, not very good.  Doesn't even come close to GODZILLA.<>Shochiku Company Limited's first foray into the monster movie genre that was exploding at this time in which every single Japanese studio had a monster movie in this particular year.  Suffice to say, this is generic run of the mill BS that is entertaining for five year olds, those who appreciate nostalgia from a certain age (and do not mind subtitles) or for those who are completely wasted and have watched almost everything under the sun or can't find the remote.  Whatever the case may be, it is a decent entry but it's far from special and it's not very good unless you're laughing at it.  The added undertone of anti-Americanism (go back to your land, screw you too Japan!) is a bit of a turn off but completely understood as the monster Guilala shows us...those bombs leveled entire cities.  We kinda still owe Japan one...or two.<>Um monstro chamado Guilala que parece o filho bastardo do Godzilla e de uma galinha de capoeira.

O que se pode pedir mais de um alucinado filme de monstros japonês?<>They can build a moon base and (at least try to) fly to Mars, but they can't develop color TV (or a variety of space travel theme music), or overcome sexist stereotypes or smoking indoors (in the moon base!).  And it seems to be, ominously, a Japanese-German (and nuclear!) partnership.  But really it's just a showcase for (actually not that bad, though dated) special effects (though the main theme seems to be fuel/energy consumption--but it also supports Japanese militarism, or self-defense).<>I would have benefited more had I had a watching-partner to laugh my ass off with.

The book is even better with the illicit romance between Rachel and Dex.<>(I made this account so I could rate this move specifically which should tell you how bad it was) (I've never been inclined to write a review for a movie before ever)

This is honestly one of the worst plots I've ever seen in my entire life. To say that I wish I could get back the minutes I wasted is an understatement. SPOILERS: It honestly just justified cheating on your partner and being an asshole for mediocre long lost love which is lame and a waste of time. If you're going to not have the balls to not be a bad friend and bad person don't make a movie about it just do it. John Krazinski's character was the only sane person the entire film and ended up being a complete throwaway in the end (he's not even in the final scenes despite him and Ginnifer Goodwin's characters being lifelong best friends for the entire film). She essentially throws away any solid relationship she has (John K) for a mediocre person who needs therapy to work through his parent issues. Kate Hudson's character was obviously awful but it doesn't warrant treating your friend like crap. I think thats all the word vomit I can say about this. Definitely don't waste your time.<>This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Poor John krasinski :(<>super cute. i love both Kate Hudson & Ginnifer Goodwin - & of course John Krasinski. it was a cute story & everyone played their parts well. I'm not sure i love how it ended, but overall i really enjoyed it. would recommend.<>Very bad writing and direction. <>What a terrible and unsatisfying ending. A disruption of friendship and casting aside of the tragic John Krasinski character in exchange for the shallow hunk.<>Another day another mediocre Romantic Comedy. In my humble opinion, this film scrapes the bottom of the Romantic Comedy barrel, similar to Emma Roberts' 2018 film ""Little Italy"" (review still coming soon). To begin I will start with the general issues I had while watching the film. Firstly the relationship between Rachel and Dex (rhymes with s*x) was unnecessarily drawn out and a clear example of terrible communication in a relationship. Frankly, it was more painful than romantic. I found myself questioning why they were even fighting so hard to get together at all. Secondly, I can not offer a feminist reading of this film due to the nauseatingly toxic female friendship depicted by Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson. The Rom-Com industrial complex is at it once again, leaving no room for the protagonist to have meaningful relationships outside of her romantic interests. Besides the fact, I think the two hated each other anyways. I mean with THAT much repressed animosity towards each other since childhood who wouldn't. On an unrelated note, I also had a friend who lied about college acceptance, Hey Briana if you're watching hope the divorce is going well. Now back to the scathing review, lastly and thirdly the men in this film were no better (thanks patriarchy). Actually, now that I think about it not a single one of these characters had a redeeming quality to be found. Now on to my character analysis that I didn't have time for in my review of ""Love Hard"" (kindly click my profile to check it out). Starting with the worst, Rachel played by Ginnifer Goodwin was the moldy pumpkin sitting in my window sill weeks after Halloween has passed. To further expand on my joke, the pity party (table of one) that she hosted throughout the film was pathetic. All her ""issues"" stemmed from a six-year ""unrequited"" love, which as it turns out was actually requited. It was her own insecurity and self-sabotaging behavior that led to her predicament. The character displayed zero interest in taking control of the agency of her life, which honestly I don't think is a great message to be sending young girls, even in 2011. 
Sorry guys, I bit off more than I can chew, the turkey's burning and I gotta get out of this house. So I'm just going to wrap this up with a few honorable mentions. Was the character Ethan played by rising star John Krasinski (whose credits include a small role on underground TV show ""The Office"" if you're familiar) homophobic? Who even was Claire? And does anyone have tips for raising a narcoleptic six-year-old? 
In conclusion, it's 2021 women can have friends, personally, I don't, but regardless the option should always be available.<>Needed more John Krasinski and maybe it would have worked. But between a toxic friendship and a cowardly, weak man who blames the “heroine” for not asking for what she wants, it’s a huge fail. Then it just ends hoping you’re left with butterflies and rainbows instead of wondering what just happened. I’m thinking that even the writers didn’t know how to bring that from out of the dark place it turned to so they just said eff it, the end. <>Are they saying it's okay to cheat on your fiancé then? And if you try hard enough, you can steal your best friend's fiancé? I bet a lot of women tried this after watching this movie, if they thought they would end up with the man. 
They're promoting and justifying being selfish. That's what the characters are-just plain selfish. Can't find one redeeming quality about this movie.","Hilary Swank, Molly Smith, Broderick Johnson, Andrew A. Kosove, Aaron Lubin, Pamela Schein Murphy","May 6, 2011 wide",$39.0M,Warner Bros.

Aneurin is absolutely phenomenal actor and really recreates Mozart well!<>This sumptuously filmed, fictional account of the gestation of Mozart's opera of Don Giovanni has a few grains of truth but the majority of the plot is fictitious. Not that this necessarily makes for a poor movie but for me, it did rather get in the way and simplify the inspiration behind the masterpiece and the creative processes that forged it. If you are hoping for a history lesson, move on, if however, you are looking for a passable costume drama, then Interlude in Prague may just fit the bill.<>This film is for the most part, a well-acted, overly dramatic, and untrue part of history that was interesting enough to make me care about it, but I definitely understand why it was only shown at select theatres. My main problem is the unbelievable drama of the film. It sometimes makes the acting seem terrible, and often times the editing makes this even worse. Besides that, I do think it is well-written and well-acted, but it is also very untrue to history. There never was a Zuzana Luptakova and when you find that out, it kind of ruins the magic that the film is true to what happened as it labels itself as a documentary. One more thing really bugged me about this movie. I myself am an opera singer and currently I am in a production of The Magic Flute (an opera by Mozart). And though the operatic scenes are well shot, the way the singers sing the opera is very synthetic, autotuned, and very untrue to the very personal, real, and natural way opera is sung. Anyways, I'd give this film a pass unless Mozart is really your thing.<>Beautiful music is a given, but also an intriguing fictional look at what might inspire a composer to create a character like Don Giovanni.

SEASON 1 - 5 Stars
What a game changing show for Quebec, it's pretty impressive to see a show that takes a lot of risks like Grande Ourse did. It gets obvious early on that Grande Ourse takes inspiration from Twin Peaks, it's a little town with a murder, people there are eccentric, the mystery is weird, and we flirt with the supernatural. I think Grande Ourse succeeds to be the Québécois equivalent to Twin Peaks and in the best way possible, if the inspiration is here, Grande Ourse is its own things. It's a TV shows that just continuously twists the story while maintaining its bizarre logic. The twists are more than gimmick, they develop the story in a meaningful and addicting way. The mystery is dense, bizarre, and every revelation is worth it. There is a strong visual identity here, each character have their own quirky style and there is a constant chiaroscuro. The humor is pretty Québécois, which can be campy and unpolished, but it is part of the charm of Grande Ourse.",,,,,,,,

It's also positively surprising that it dedicates time to explore Chambers's rape conviction, though the eventual ambiguity might justly raise some eyebrows (and Hill's self-professed intentions only make matters worse).<>A surprisingly good boxing movie with a breezy runtime and an economically told story.  It's bare-bones in its execution and paced very well with never a dull moment.  An undefeated professional boxer squares off against an undefeated prison boxer; simple premise, yet told without any bloated unnecessary subplots.  Snipes and Rhames character's respectively get their own backstories, and I was left rooting for both of them during their final bout.  I do wish the verdict of Iceman George's (Rhames) rape charge had been revealed, giving us some closure on his circumstance.  Also, after the big fight, it would've been a nice touch if Monroe (Snipes) and George showed each other good sportsmanship such as was done after the final fights in films like the original Karate Kid and some of the Rocky movies.  These are relatively minor nitpicks however, for an overall satisfying and surprisingly effective prison boxing drama.

Nobody plays boxing.""<>It's just a building-up hype for last fight!Music and soundtracks were good,acting was decent mike Tyson was okay Wesley Snipes was amazing loved the art in his cell,The character Ripstein was literally star amazing performance and his love for sport and good ending with his honesty and definitely his F#ing Speech and some dialogues were amazing!Story was okay so does screenplay but the flow of movie was issue starting and ending was amazing the middle portion is just boring and build up for fight,the characters were too much in it and i didn't connect with them at all,overall one time watch.<>I am not a pro boxer but fights in this movie are good, not perfect and Wesley Snipes's acting was great 
The background story of two boxers isn't full explained<>The movie sure wasn't deep in any way, but I thought it was good. Ving Rhames was fantastic, so was Wesley Snipes. <>One of the most uninteresting boxing films I've ever seen.  Generic to the core and the boxing scenes were probably the worst part of the film<>starring Wesley Snipes and ving rymes<>This movie is only watchable because of Ving Rhaemes and Wesley Snipes. I give it one star for each of them. Else, it's frustrating to sit and watch. It's a clichéd poorly written and directed movie.<>Good popcorn viewer.nothing more but that's enough.<>Writer/Director Walter Hill has a funny quote about his film,  ""Some say Hollywood movies that are made about boxing are just metaphors for other things, I think I've made one that's actually about boxing and not a metaphor."" And it's the films' unpretentious, stripped down luddite approach that's it's real charm. Wesley Snipes plays the prison boxing champion Monroe ""Undisputed"" Hutchens when a Mike Tyson-like world heavyweight champion, Ving Rhames, is sent to the same prison over a Robin Givens-like incident. Rhames is great as the full-of-himself arrogant George ""Iceman"" Chambers, but the best performance in the film belongs to Peter Falk as aging mafia boss Mendy Ripstein. Ripstein's mind is starting to fail him, but his mind is sharp as a tack when it comes to boxing and using his influence arranges for a secret boxing match between the two champions fighting under London Prize Ring Rules, which predated the Queensberry rules. The film follows the simple formula of Rhames as the loudmouth bad guy and Snipes as the tightlipped underdog hero of the prison, all building to the climactic boxing match. There's nothing terribly original about this story, but Walter Hill does this sort of stripped down action film better than anyone and Rhames, Snipes and particularly Falk bring an amount of gravitas to the film that really do make this film something special for fans of boxing pictures. The colorful supporting cast includes Michael Rooker, Wes Studi, Fisher Stevens, Ed Lover, Master P and Peter Jason. There has been two sequels made to this film, which maybe makes me think that this film may actually have the fan base that it deserves.","David Giler, Walter Hill, Brad Krevoy, Andrew Sugerman","Aug 23, 2002 wide",,Miramax Films,R (Strong Language),Scope (2.351),"Surround, Dolby SR, Dolby Digital, Dolby A, Dolby Stereo",

Seazer, Kuni Kawachi, Itsuro Shimoda, Masayoshi Sukita, Keiichi Uraoka, Seiichi Hayashi","Terayama experiments with aesthetics to sharpen his social critique of youth's alienation in modern Japanese society, but the heteroclite and rupturist treatment does not solve a hollow result. [Full review in Spanish]","A few interesting shots aside, it's a chore to sit through, a random mess with a fuck-ton of grating jumpcuts and no cohesion. It alternates between making no sense and beating you over the head with simplistic ideas and the most blatant exposition ever. Filming a photo of the characters and narrating who's who? The protagonist literally running away from his house and shouting his family issues at the top of his lungs? Oh look, an American flag and a Coca Cola bottle, imperialism's bad, mm'kay?<>Terayama's metacinema is an avant-garde manifesto disguised as a circus theater.
It is an eccentric social critique of modern Japan, deprived of soul and morally decadent, enslaved by capitalism and subjugated by the blind obsession with America.
The search for subjectivity in a society tending to the oppressive homologation culminates in some symbolic acts of anarchic awareness: young people tear off their uniforms and make love on the railways in a sexual liberation impulse; they burst into the streets; they burn the American flag.
Peace is not ephemeral as Peace cigarette smoke; freedom cannot be dictated by the illusory promises of the so-called ""economic miracle""; self-consciousness is only achievable by throwing away the absurd constraints of the hypocritical and materialistic Japanese society.
The nameless protagonist opens a Pandora's box: the mother is a shoplifter, the father a pervert, the sister mentally unstable; the real face of post-war Japan is not the respectable mask it awkwardly tries to put on (showed to the world during the ‘64 Olympic Games), but a corrupt and degenerate one.
Recurring themes in the provocative artistic production of the Art Theater Guild (ATG), the independent film production company active in Japan between the 1960s and 1980s that promoted mostly New Wave films and ""cinéma d'auteur"".
Terayama's stylistic approach is experimental and extravagant. The unconventional narrative structure is, perhaps, too often disordered, but creates an inspired pastiche with influences from Russian literature, Noh theater and prog rock music.
Inter-cut by surreal monochromatic scenarios, the nihilist rebellious act of the youthful disillusionment is a socialist song with psychedelic tones.
""Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets"" is a hymn to freedom of expression, an accomplished self-liberation coming-of-age, the last desperate scream against the inevitable Japanese conformity.

""The city is an open book. Write on its infinite margins!""<>?? ???? ??????? ???? ????? "" ???????? ????????? "" :)<>You could easily dismiss ""Throw Away Your Books"" at first sight, as nothing more than a product of 60s counter culture. The thing is, the movie resonates still to this day, and many things easily apply to any culture, not just modern Japan. Sexual relations, friendship, family, everything is either a joke, a charade or just never a honest thing. It's a honest reflexion on the frustrations of not only young people, but people from any age group. Even when the movie starts going heavily into ""performance"" mode it doesn't sabotage the entire thing.<>I really hesitate to jump to any conclusions when it comes to cemented greatness, especially because I have only just seen this film for the first time. But let me say that Shuji Terayama is one of my favorite filmmakers. This is the best film I have seen by him, and quite possibly one of the best films I have ever seen period.
This is a work of extreme power and beauty. Its themes of disillusionment, coming of age, anarchy and the failure of dreams are so universal and powerful, that despite the specificity of the Japanese New Wave and late 1960's counter culture that influenced them, the work still resonates with a intensity and intelligence only shared by the greatest of films (Malick's ""The Tree of Life"", Bergman's ""Persona"", and Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" come to mind, among others.) It is one of those works of art that seems to understand the human condition, what it means to exist and the entire scope of this existence. I am so profoundly moved by this work and by Teryama in general, and cannot wait to re-examine this film.
Genius near unparalleled.<>Novelistic story of a young man on a soccer team who has a dysfunctional family, intercut with a liberal amount of vignettes that vary in content, length and quality; ""Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets"" defies description as it boldly breaks the laws of cinema. Experimentation is conducted, the wilder the better. Green-tinted flashbacks, purple fantasies, musical interludes, subliminal editing, daring sequences with the actors acting strangely in public (a la ""Borat""), wanton disregard for three-act structure or basic necessities like the Fourth Wall. With its Dostoevskian number of characters obsessed with the state of Japan circa 1971, and the overall varying successes of its myriad cinematic experiments, ""TAYB, RitS"" might be a trying viewing experience for those not in the right state of mind for it. 

Overall, its a bumpy and kind of overlong ride, but well worth it for the cumulative effect. While the concluding speech (with the tableau of assembled film crew) goes on for an Onanistic length, the film finally ends with what are without a doubt the greatest ending credits ever.

Very much interested to check out more of Shuji Terayama's work, but it seems to be hard to come across in the States.<>Excellent.  Shuji Terayama is a complete master when it comes to color.  An amazing film about a dysfunctional family dealing with elements of alienation and social activism.  The whole segment about the little girl and her rabbit was truly haunting.  This is probably the best film I have ever seen.","Shuji Terayama, Eiko Kujo",,,,,,,

It's timed perfectly for a presidential election year, but plays it extremely safe on the political front.  Its redeeming quality is that it is clean and family-friendly.

TIPS FOR PARENTS:
You might want to read The Prince and the Pauper: Original Illustrations with your kids.
Alcohol and some people get drunk.
Some stereotypes
No profanity
It's a VERY light introduction to politics for kids.

THINGS I LIKED:
I like that the First Lady knows history and tries to preserve it and teach it.
I only recognized two actors in the entire cast.  One was Corbin Bernsen, who received multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for his role in LA Law: Season 1 (Official US Version)  .  The other was Stacey Dash, most famous for her role in Clueless . I hadn't seen either of them in anything recently, so it was good to see them.  It's also nice to see new actors in a cast given a chance in Hollywood. 
The cartoon fairy tale opening was cute, so I had high hopes for the movie.
THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Terrible, terrible acting.  I've liked Corbin Bernsen in other things over the years, but his accent was atrocious in this movie and faded in and out.  The actor who plays him as a younger man has an American accent.  What the heck?  There is no attention to detail in this movie.  What was the need of his accent anyway?  Everyone in his kingdom had a different one or spoke with an American accent.
The jaunty music tells you not to take the movie seriously.
None of the characters are very likable. Most of them are over-the-top ridiculous, but not in a funny way.
Super stiff dialogue
Super predictable.  The movie poster gives the story away.
I kept waiting to laugh.  I wanted to laugh, but the humor just wasn't there.
That fake dog.  Seriously?
The costumes were SUPER cheap looking.
So much talk about coffee.  What's up with that?
The paid protesters outside the White House were a sad statement, although a true one.
Terrible editing, especially at the 1 hour 31 minute mark.
Sandra Belforte's character, Cameron, changes her political stance and personality overnight.
No chemistry among the romantic leads.  That's a pretty big problem for a romantic comedy, don't you think?
The sets look like they were filmed in someone's personal house, and I'm not talking about the White House.
Beyond the main romance (such as it is), another romance is implied between one of the First Lady's assistants and a White House guest in a wheelchair, but absolutely nothing happens and that story line completely drops.

Whistle worthy!<>Master - 8.5/10. Lokesh Kanagaraj has created a style of filmmaking within just 3 films in Kollywood. Bringing a 90s Hollywood action genre flavour to tamil cinema has been his forte so far in his career, and Master is another example of that. Though a departure of some sorts from his previous features (Maanagaram and Kaithi), Master is his own twist on the hero centric masala films that are always to be found in Tamil cinema. Though the story is basically template Vijay tropes thrown into a redux version of Nammavar, Lokesh has kept his promise in terms of bringing a different Vijay on screen. We see a Vijay who has flaws (a drunk and kind of slight jerk) and also see some character growth that grants for the transformative motion to becoming the hero in the story. He has upped his acting game, really showing his growth as an actor outside of the showmanship. And then there's Vijay Sethupathi, who also does an excellent job as the murderous Bhavani. Though there's shades of Vedha in the character, he does a great job in making a menacing villain. Outside of the leads the rest of the star filled cast do their job well, with Lokesh once again proving he has a good eye on casting the right people to be in his films. Though the story could have been a little more inventive, it does an effective job. The way the story shows the duality of the leads (the good guy being an alcoholic carefree person whereas the bad guy is a teetotaller with ambition) is inventive and makes the familiar story a little different. Anirudh hits it out of the park with the high energy music, with the cinematography of Sathyan Sooryan a highlight as well. Though a great film, I'm really excited to see what Lokesh has coming up with Vikram! The first good film of 2021!",Xavier Britto,,,,R (Language|Some Drug Use),,,

And it stays away from any of her complexities and controversies leaving us with a fairly one-dimensional portrayal.<>At nearly 2.5 hours, the film could've been shorn a bit, but it's a worthy tribute to an iconic woman's extraordinary life.<>Julie Taymor's gift for visual storytelling works as both literal and metaphoric depiction of Gloria Steinem's extraordinary life.<>It is indeed an empowering and uplifting experience...<>It's a fitting achievement to a truly remarkable woman, and the strength of an entire movement, and a reminder that, as far as equality is concerned, we still have many more miles to go.<>The film lauds all of these accomplishments, but it also takes the time to acknowledge some of the costs of full-time activism.<>What a treat to see two terrific actors - Alicia Vikander and Julianne Moore - allowed to creat a portrait of a woman so complex, so well-rounded, so fully and messily human. Brava.<>The films jumps around a bit - if you're not well versed with the history you might get lost from time-to-time - but it is important recent history and a life story worth celebrating.<>A very special disaster.<>Providing both factual details and relevant ideas, The Glorias acknowledges its subject's failures, as well as successes, and applauds her determination to keep on fighting for her beliefs.<>In these precarious times, where we seem poised on the brink between democracy and despair, The Glorias still manages to present a message of hope.<>There's a good film to be made about Gloria Steinem, a complex human and a pioneer of later 20th-century feminism. [The Glorias] isn't it.<>Poignant and intimate, the narrative isn't afraid to take its time, flowing between decades and locales as if in a free-associative dream state.<>The period trappings are colourful, but the script is non-stop exposition.<>If all this sounds like a rattle-through, it is, however inventive and thoughtful.<>A slightly exhausting film that is smothered by its reverence for its subject.<>Difficult as biopics can be, The Glorias should have been glorious.<>The film's heart is in the right place, but The Glorias doesn't stand a chance with Taymor at the helm.<>Steinem is one of the most influential women in the United States in the past 50 years, but The Glorias fails to show exactly why that is. Turning her portrayal over to four different actors is a great idea, but the film never finds its footing.<>The Glorias isn't a standard biopic, but it also isn't as radical as its subject. It's an artfully arranged greatest hits package of a remarkable and influential life that dilutes its impact by trying to cover eighty of Steinem's years.","Filme bom.

It's great the director and movie put women's right, black right, native American, Asian American, gay rights all together, it's human's right! It's a much holistic way to look at things, and what's going on today in the world.  Julian Moore's speech at Catholic church is the most touching one, how in human history, men gradually alienate from nature, but make the church more isolated from nature and built hierarchy with white male God as the image, all the important female figures all became background. I believe in women's movement and the pro-choice. I can't believe it is still being discussed today.  Human has the choice for his/her life, as long he/her is responsible for the the choice he/she made, no one should tell him/her otherwise. That is basic human right! I can't believe the low rating the movie gets. It's the message it's carry that's way more important than the format itself. Do u all get the messages?<>This was not a movie, it was a pamphlet. (And I am a feminist and liberal and I actually stand behind everything that was in the film). Looked good, actors were great (although the accent Vikander did was weird) and the Wizard of Oz scene was great. I learned a lot about Steinem, so that's a good thing.

There are the typical amazing stunts, comical situations and super thin plot.<>Shot before Chan had broken every bone in his body twice, the spry Chan had such agility and quickness it's truly frightening to watch.<>This one has even less use for plot than Armour of God, and displays much more intricately choreographed slapstick, demonstrating that Chan sees himself as much a physical comedian as a martial arts action star.","This was the film that proved that Chan could make any sized film he wanted and it would be great.<>Best of Movies/TV Series Collection<>Jackie Chan along with Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung certainly know how to deliver the martial arts within a fun and humorous story.<>Project A has a clock tower stunt in it, but Jackie Chan had not seen the films of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd when he made this movie, as they were not available on home video. He saw this as the evolution of comedy, action and martial arts that he'd been working on since The Young Master.

This movie and Dragon Lord were the first films since Jackie came back from his initial failed time in America and he had something to prove.

Sergeant Dragon Ma (Chan) is part of the Hong Kong Marine Police, which is battling both pirates and their Hong Kong Police rivals. After one fight oo many, the Marine and regular police have to join forces.

Beyond Dragon Ma, Project A also has Sammo Hung as Zhuo ""Fei"" Yifei and Yuen Baio as Inspector Hong Tin-Tzu. In time, they all join together to face pirate lord Lor Sam Pau (Dick Wei), who is smuggling guns directly from the cops.

Up until Project A came out, Hong Kong movies didn't have the large sets and attention to period detail that other movies did. It's also a film that isn't all fighting, but instead a mix of action and combat.<>There is a sub-rule to Chekhov's Gun known as 'Chan's Window' - if there is a large, decorative window introduced in a Jackie Chan movie, someone MUST be thrown through it at some point.

A pretty entertaining but kind of wandering martial arts film, never really developing an established flow but instead drifting between subplots for most of the runtime. Hung's Fats feels like he's been written into the story at the last minute, as if his schedule opened up a week before filming and Jackie Chan thought his buddy would make the film better. There's plenty of the solid action comedy that the genre, and Chan, would continue to refine for the next couple of decades, and several cleverly designed fights designed to showcase the capabilities of the choreography, like climbing up a flagpole to escape being handcuffed to it. A fun enough ride, but not up to the level of several genre contemporaries made around the same time. (2.5/5)<>An early Jacky Chan production with Fatso.  This was before Jacky found his mantra though and it struggled.  The dubbing and plot was comical, while the rest of it was tedious.

The acting is atrociously bad. The villain is not good, the adults are so generic and lack any charm or chemistry with the kids it's cringeworthy. The babies are clueless and their eyes and facial expressions don't ever match with the words or mouth movement. This goes to the fundamental problem that babies can't act. The cinematography is just as equally bad. Stupid camera angles, dumb scenes, and dumb bad jokes besides the bomb threat which was good.The music is the same looped bad music played throughout 80% of the time feeling really obnoxious. The editing and pacing are the worst part of this movie. Half the film there is no story and because there is no charm, chemistry or any wittiness it makes things drag beyond belief. The story that is here is so stupid and the rules make no sense (Babies Crossing Over, The fact they can solve Einstein Equations but can't potty train) is such a dumb idea that is just designed just to have parents go see this and be focused on the adorable kids rather than any story telling. (Perfect example is the 3 minute ending montage of kids at the end with the sappy music meant to tug at heart strings and make you forget the horrible movie you just watched) Give this to your toddler and have them flush it down the toilet where it belongs.<>LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>A great cast sadly wasted.<>so bad it's good. young children will find this movie absolutely hysterical.<>Tom is Tom a movie going with me and I<>It's not good.

I remember watching this movie as a little kid and having terrible vivid nightmares. Sometimes I bring up this movie with my friends to make them laugh. I'd like to make it clear that we're laughing AT it not WITH it. Any intentional jokes are unfunny and don't land, and all the other lines are cringy and the actors clearly don't want to be there. The plot is so utterly insane that I think about it nearly every week and I haven't watched it for years. The CGI... nonexistent. The athletic scenes make me want to sob and laugh at the same time. The babies mouths barely even move to the words..? This is no doubt the worst movie I have ever witnessed in my life time. I would like to buy a DVD for this movie just to light it on fire.<>I will give some credit to this otherwise awful film, that it is better than its abysmal sequel Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. On paper, it doesn't look so bad, it has a great cast including beautiful Kathaleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd who is a lot of fun in pretty much everything he's in and the late Dom DeLuise. If only, if only it had a decent enough script and a good enough plot. However, the film is severely lacking in both areas, and makes a waste of those truly talented actors.

The script is just awful, and doesn't give anyone enough to work with, and there is no originality or sophistication. The story is one that has been done before and better about a nasty children's magnate who is carrying out tests on a host of brainy little children on the premise that they can speak in a secret language. Bob Clark's direction is very unfocused throughout, and doesn't improve whatsoever. The camera-work is rushed, and the slapstick is uninspiredly staged. In fact, if there was a redeeming quality, the soundtrack was okay to say the least.

The performances are disappointingly poor, and they are not helped by the lacklustre direction and the witless script. To be honest I found triplets Leo, Myles and Gerry Fitzgerald very irritating as the twins who try to outmatch Dr Kinder. As for Turner, this has to be a career low for her. This is a shame, because she is so beautiful and talented, but her strengths aren't even put to use here and she does overact quite wildly. Christopher Lloyd usually excels in roles similar to the one he has here, but he looks embarrassed here and looks as though he wants to get it all out of the way. And Dom DeLuise? For such a talented and versatile actor like DeLuise, you would expect a lot from him. But his part is so badly underwritten that he comes across as wasted.

All in all, sorry but I didn't like this movie.

But it is fun.<>It's a simple premise and execution, the colours are bright, the familiarity of the characters is warming despite the jarring American accents, and it's all breezy fun.<>Passable but patchy, this animated adventure wobbles between wryly amusing, laugh-out-loud funny and charmlessly frenetic.<>The equivalent of the last comic on the shelf at the campsite supermarket: it may provide some distraction, but don't expect much.<>The film is packed with great visual gags (there's a remarkably high hit-rate in that regard) and it stays largely true to the spirit of the books, give or take a talking boar or two.<>It's such gleefully ridiculous fun that it's impossible to mind too much.<>Sadly, Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion is unlikely to hook a new generation of fans given its substandard CG animation, its rubbish Harry Potter-riffing plot, and the fact that the title character barely features.<>Honours the spirit of the books with grace and integrity.<>Devotees of the characters of diminutive Asterix and his hulking friend Obelix - and there are many - no doubt will celebrate that the latest film in the franchise is getting a cinema release, albeit a limited one.<>The films have always been more kid-oriented than the books and this one won't frighten the school-age ones, although it might raise a few hairs on those younger. Adults might enjoy the knowing glimpses of the real world.<>On the plus side though, the story should more than satisfy young Asterix fans and the character names are as memorable as ever.<>Meets the two fundamental requirements of an Asterix movie: it will amuse lifelong fans and make future readers want to discover the brilliance of Goscinny and Uderzo.

[Full review in Spanish]<>Unlike other Gallic attempts at this kind of big budget tongue-in-cheek cartoon, at least the directors know how to pull theirs off with slick efficiency and a fair amount of wit, even if the scenario itself feels far too simplistic.","All ages admitted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<>It might not be the best movie starring the iconic animated duo but it still has the same fast animation and humour to make it entertaining<>Our family enjoyed this one as it was an entertaining and witty animated movie with a nice story<>Animation movies are fun to watch, here's Asterix and Obelix out on new missions, they have to find an heir to make the famous strength drink<>Nice cartoon for the family to watch, could have been better!<>I am a big fan of Asterix and love most of the movies. Both the animation ones and the ones with actors. However this movie seems like a desperate attempt to make a young, computer game, Disney, Americanised version of the Asterix universe.  Bad music, things exploding all the time. comedy sounds, everyone falling over for laughs or loud screaming for no reason. It seems like the people who made this movie, didn't believe in the Asterix universe that so many people love.<>Not as good as The Mansions of the Gods, which came out at a time when fans really could've used an animated movie to take the bad taste of the last two live-action movies out of their mouths, with a more juvenile feel and, had it been a standalone movie, likely not that much different from your average Hollywood animated movie. It also doesn't help that Twelve Tasks comparisons have to be taken into account since this is the first Asterix movie in 42 years to tell an original story when even Take on Caesar's plot was a mix-and-match of village-based stories. But, if you're an Asterix fan, you'll more than likely enjoy his second CGI adventure with colourful animation that's visually superior to the last movie, a story that does a decent job tackling the topic of passing the torch (one problem I've had with Asterix, primarily in Conquers America is that the villagers at times seem to be weaklings whose reliance on the magic potion means that once Getafix dies, they're screwed), a well-done English dub and a fun climax. Please, have these two direct all Asterix movies from now on. Movies like this and the superior Mansions of the Gods are what happens when your directors are a former Pixar animator and a guy who made it clear 4 years ago thathe was a fan. Aww, now I'm out of Asterix movies to review. Well, this 2-year-long journey of film adaptations of the poster boy for Franco-Belgian comics was fun. There were good, there were bad, but overall I'm glad I took this journey. Guess now I'll play the PS4 games having already completed the first XXL game on PS2 months before I saw that abysmal Olympic Games movie. Farewell, Asterix reviews. May we meet again, by Toutatis.<>Only really for people who are already fans, a lot of it relies on understanding the whole thing already. Genuinely hilarious, though more a goofy humour, and missing some of the bitingly clever satirical and self-aware edges that the absolute best Asterix stories have. If that's all fine with you, then it's well-recommended.<>The Secret of the Magic Potion is a good movie.
Yeah, that's really about it. The visual puns are pretty funny, the animation is amazing and it's good, like I said. The villain is fine, the journey across the land is fine, everything's pretty much fine. I know it was the point, but Asterix's behavior near the end of the second act was harsh and out of character, which is my main criticism.<>If you are a fan of Asterix, this newest edition will surely delight you as well. The visual are very different (not like the paper cartoon version anymore, but a very 3D digitized look), not really my cup of tea, but surely opening the door to more details and image depth. The story has more pep and varied sub-stories than any of the former movies which also make it more interesting. There aren't as many real laughs as one might expect, but it is, once again, a sweet, lovable animation for young and old to enjoy. I had a good time. 6 1/2 of 10 points.  ",,,,,,,,

Less inspiration.<>Like the vast majority of Ritchie's work, The Gentlemen is both entertaining and almost instantly forgettable<>The cast is top notch and everyone is on their A-game, and it gives more fodder for Sons of Anarchy fans to boast about what Hunnam can do when he's directed well.<>The Gentlemen is easily Ritchie's best movie in years. Each of the actors, from the big stars to the bit players, is a joy to watch, and they bring the story to life even when the plot mechanics threaten to drive it into a ditch.<>London underworld story, Guy Ritchie style, but with maturity and Hollywood faces to reward the two decades experience.<>Sometimes, The Gentlemen gives the impression that Ritchie doesn't consider this a return to form so much as an insistence that no number of flops would dare issue him a comeuppance.<>But it feels sloppily made without a coherent tone and while there are some great performances, they don't entirely work next to each other.<>As rock 'n rolling as the filmmaking is, the story acts as an anchor, bogging things down as it gets more and more convoluted.<>The Gentlemen is a crisp and comedic action entertainer with fascinating characters.<>Guy Ritchie returns to his British crime caper roots with this fun but disposable bit of malarky.<>This is not a bad crime drama, it's an awful one.<>Cool, snappy, fun and stupidly entertaining, this is evidence of a director flexing his established genre muscles and allowing himself to have a bit of fun once more.<>Yes, Ritchie's been down this narrative road before but his approach in realizing it on screen is far less manic and self-conscious, making for a far mature, grounded work than his previous efforts<>Leaving aside the story about the marijuana boss played by Matthew McConaughey (love u), I want to focus on Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell.

It is too bad that it adds up to less than the sum of its parts due to its aggressive self-referential attitude and its blatant racism.","Brilliant film except for one major flaw... Hugh Grant! Would have been considerably better with someone else in that role!
Also... controversial opinion, there was an overuse of the C word.

That's the review!!<>Great movie, good script,  good balance 👌🏽<>Don't know what it is about Matthew McConaughey, but I'm not quite a fan of his 100%. I think that he does the same exact role in every single movie. It does not deliver anything else. I really wish that he would develop his characters and not be so one-sided. I think that he is a great actor in certain things, but most things are not. And this film is one of them. I think this is another film that was heed up to be bigger than what it should've been. It was definitely a boring experience that wasted my time. I think if you enjoy this type of film, great, I think that's an amazing. But this definitely one of those that could just sat on the shelf.<>It was simply amazing. The casting was superb, the action was jam packed and exciting, and the overall feel of the movie made it seem like you were really there with them, selling bush and killing for cash.<>The Gentlemen is a fresh spin on the crime genre, elevated with effortless British charisma. This film sweeps you along with terrific performances, cheeky dialogue, and slice-and-dice action sequences. The screenplay is fast-paced and high energy, with outrageous plot twists demanding your attention. Its witty, fun, and relentlessly entertaining, leaving me craving for more even after it was over.<>It was a bit too violent and too dark for me in parts. Also, something about a lot of the acting and especially the dialogue just seemed really over the top and unbelievable. Normally I love non-PC gangster movies but this one just didn't quite sell me. I probably would have liked it better if the bad guys (which was nearly all the characters basically) had ended up in jail or killed.<>Absolutely brilliant English gangster movie.  
Hugh Grant was amazing in this.<>cool film matthew mcconoughy is great guy richie doesnt disappoint.<>This movie does so many things so well. Though it is expected from a Guy Ritchie film, the style is unmatched. The cast was perfect. No role felt like it would have been better with a different actor, even though that may be the case for some of them. Charlie Hunnam has good report with both Hugh Grant and Matthew McConaughey. The acting was done very well and very quick. As for the writing and directing, the quick jumping around through the story can be off-putting or odd on the first watch. However, after watching it a second time, I found it much easier to follow. The film is decent fun if you watch it once. However, I have found the more I watch it, the better it becomes.

It's not enough, but it's something.<>The debate and stories all add up to the very convincing message that dialog is the only road to peace in the Middle East, and that there's still a very long journey ahead to reach that destination.<>The film doesn't provide any easy answers; there are no easy answers in this case. But what it does offer is reflection and empathy...<>The state of affairs in the Middle East may actually be thornier than it seems from afar: that is the position this brave, intimate perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to take.<>What sets Hava Kohav Beller's documentary apart is the intense colloquy at its disheartening heart: a series of discussions among young Palestinians and Israelis during a retreat in Germany.<>The film could have benefited from some judicious cutting to tighten the narrative. It is not, as the marketing would have it, a suspenseful film. It is, however, a very depressing but necessary one.<>The dialogue sessions are the heart and the best part of In the Land of Pomegranates.<>Amidst tense airings of grievances, context is set against beautiful images of the disputed homeland, archival footage, and personal testimonials of clashes and cooperation.<>An unwieldy, unfocused work that just gets lost in its own ambitious striving for objectivity and scope.<>Informative and thought-provoking.<>This sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing documentary looks at a unique effort to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians.<>If watching it is frustrating, so is the larger process of seeking understanding, or at least a nonviolent mutual tolerance.<>The film is a jumble, with no sense of meaningful interaction ...<>Everyone interviewed in this sobering documentary - Israeli or Palestinian - agrees that something must be done to stop the bloodshed in their land. But even talking about solutions proves problematic.<>[Beller's] deep-rooted empathy and compassion is plainly evident in her latest effort, but it's not enough to compensate for the tedium engendered by the meandering debates whose impact ultimately adds up to very little.<>Young Palestinians and Israelis meet in Germany to discuss their differences. Background filming is ample. The dialogue between the two groups is same ol' with the result that they may leave the conferences with even more hatred.","In the Land of Pomegranates attempted to show a long-standing conflict with some kind of balance. But from the beginning, and opening with ï¿ 1/2this land is promised to us in the Torahï¿ 1/2Â?, I was surprised at how this movie focused so much on the Israeli perspective, and much less to the Palestinian narrative. 

The movie jacket focuses on intense discussions between twenty-something Israelis and Palestinians during an event in Germany called Vacation from War. These discussions were confrontational, and brought up resentments, accusations and even a poignant epiphany from an Israeli woman, which I found to be the highlight of the whole documentary. 

But there was a lot of switching back and forth from discussions, to interviews, to bloody streets scenes in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem resulting from Palestinian suicide bombers. I kept wondering when the movie would show Israelï¿ 1/2(TM)s destruction of Gaza, or its demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, but these scenes were not forthcoming. 

Although the movie was released in 2018, the discussions happened in 2007. What this means is that the participants did not discuss some truly horrendous events that happened since gathering together - the building of many more Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land in the West Bank, illegal under international law, and three major assaults by Israel on Gazaï¿ 1/2(TM)s 1.8 million people, resulting in the deaths of 3700 Palestinians, plus destruction of important infrastructure.  Therefore, discussions over a decade ago have less relevancy for todayï¿ 1/2(TM)s viewers, for such discussions would be very different now.

The few interviews went on far too long, such as the trauma of PTSD experienced by an Israeli man injured by a suicide bomber, which also had a huge impact on his family. But no PTSD trauma interviews were given to Palestinians, despite family members being shot or killed. Another Israeli, a woman living beside the border wall with Gaza who spoke about Israel needing to keep her secure, was also given a lot of movie time. But we saw no interview of life in Gaza on the other side of the wall. 

And a very long story (perhaps totalling 15 minutes) showed a Palestinian mother escorting her young child from Gaza to an Israeli hospital where he would receive needed heart surgery. Unfortunately, the filmmaker chose to have the movieï¿ 1/2(TM)s viewers endure far too much walking down hallways and time spent with doctors. And I cannot shake the feeling that this story was manipulative, included to show that Israel does indeed have compassion for a Palestinian child. Yet we were certainly not informed about Israelï¿ 1/2(TM)s lack of compassion for the 300+ Palestinian children held in Israeli jails for standing up to their oppressors.

Ultimately, this documentary failed to offer any understanding of Palestinian resistance to Israelï¿ 1/2(TM)s harsh military occupation of more than 50 years.<>Unfortunately, by the end of this meandering yet fascinating documentary, viewers are left with the impression that such attempts to bridge gaps and heal wounds, however well-intentioned, will have, at best, extremely limited success.

Even if the protagonist is actually a man in drag, The Belles of St. Trinian's still stands out as a notably early example of women presented in film as actual characters rather than porcelain doll or femme fatale figures, though I'd stop short of calling it the Black Narcissus of comedies. A creative introduction to the comedy of Alastair Sim, one of an endless list of once-prominent actors whose name has fallen through the cracks of popular culture and failed to endure to the present day through no fault of his own. The story can hardly claim to be entirely sewn up, with subplots that just sort of peter out, but the comedic timing of Sim and the consistently rowdy nature of 'her' students carry the day.

Is the story good? YES. Better than you remember, anyways - plot parallels cold war era hostilities and the bargain for peaceful cooperation (incentivized by civil security issues, environmental crisis) vs the warmongers, ie: people that would stage an assassination or blow up a few ships because war = profits. 

The movie has a nice range of settings and sci-fi creature designs, props and costumes are quite lavish, the film also combines political intrigue with a nice whodunnit theme about sabotage. 

Like much (nearly everything) in the Star Trek universe, the concept is great, the actors are memorable but there's something curiously distant and unengaging at the story's core. In this film however, there's a human element at play, largely constructed from real and historical events. Overall, this is a well acted, well written film with great shots, tought editing and a bit of humour to balance things out.<>I like how the Klingon who was worried about losing their culture quotes human literature the whole time.<>Arguably the best of the original 6 Star Trek films. Must see for any Star Trek or sci-fi fan!!<>Have you ever seen a movie where the conclusion was obvious from the start? It is this movie. Everyone is aware that the Federation were the Americans and the Clingons were the Soviets. They made the decision to put a stop to the Trek War, in which the walls came falling down, with the end of the Cold War. The major shocker at the end is completely predictable. Shatner's fight at the Cligons prison is what keeps the movie from failing. Final verdict: entertaining, but more of the same. 6/10 Will Star Trek ever end like other shows because it keeps reinventing itself in new movies and television episodes.<>This is an all-around great Trek production with a great story and great score.<>L'epilogo di quello che probabilmente è l'equipaggio più famoso della storia del cinema.
Lo scontro finale contro il nemico più temuto ed odiato, l'unico presente durante quasi tutta la saga, si scatena con un mix di azione, complotti e tensione che rende questo sci fi molto intrigante e divertente.

Is it a little cheesy? Yes. Is it high art? No, not at all. But at least the writing is serviceable even at its worst, the characters are likable, and the plot is reasonable.

As is the case with all of the movies the production design and special effects are outstanding.  However what makes this movie work is the cast.  The regular cast members all do very well.  The late Leonard Nimoy and the late DeForest Kelley have some of their best scenes together in this movie especially the scene where they are modifying the photon torpedo during the climactic battle scene.  This movie also benefits from an excellent supporting cast late Academy Award winner Christopher Plummer is great as the conniving General Chang (Who happens to be a die hard fan of William Shakespeare.).  You are almost always guaranteed an excellent performance from celebrated actor David Warner as Chancellor Gorkon.  Though his part his rather small, you will certainly not forget his excellent performance.  The scene where Capitan Kirk and his crew welcome Gorkon and his officers for dinner on board Enterprise is very well done.  In the end, Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country"" is a very fitting final episode for the original crew of Enterprise.  I certainly recommend the movie.

His best friend shows up out of nowhere after five years and they instantly take off where they left off as young rebels against the norm.  Now he's at a crossroads in his life and haunted by what if's.  


The actors are top notch in this film and the story is wholly original and one that raises great questions that are rarely discussed openly.  Many a men settle down and many a men have a hard time letting go of the wild days of their youth and sometimes this shows as a midlife crisis later on in their lives.  Metroland started off a little slow for me, but engaged me deeply after in no time.  I can recall many films that have used short flashback sequences and Metroland had plenty of them early on, but I can't recall one that included a very long thorough flashback in the way Metroland did.  It takes us back early on into his life in Paris as an artist in love with his French girlfriend he met before meeting his wife.  This flashback sequence is so long that it feels like a different movie, but when it's over and we're taken back to his present day it feels perfect.  9/10 from me.",Andrew Bendel,"May 28, 1997 original",$299.5K,,R,,Surround,

I haven't seen this one since it came out, but it made an impression on me as a kid. This one is important because it's not only a platform for gay men (and women???) to ogle the preeminent male models of the 80s, but it also shows how men can exploit their own kind just as easily as they can sexually exploit women.

In this film, we have the male lead who's broke and sees other men as objects (just like Rupaul) and goes: Let me sexually exploit you for cash! It's a fabulous business until the loan sharks eat me all up for recognizing I exploited the vulnerability of others for free content and to pay my own bills. Oh, and don't forget to Love Yourself ;)

Of course the lady love has to clean up all this sexploitation by shaming her boyfriend, like ""Are you selling balls for your education?"" or maybe sensing her man was just a little too into his seasonal work in the calendar industry.

This film wraps it all up in a nice little moral (from what I can remember) which is: Don't take out loans to sell men for sex...I think...???<>its my cheesy movie from the 80's<>Typical 80's fluff--loved it for what it was.<>Classic trashy 80's - awesome!

Not as good as Kong's previous effort, R-POINT.<>I found this film to be like if R Point and The Thing had a baby.  Except it's not as good as both.  The Thing is amazing and R Point, while solid, was kind of a chore to go through.  The film gets the atmosphere down perfectly, but it's also mixed with some blood and gore here and there.  While it is partly atmospheric, this is closer to a ""zombie"" movie than it is a ghost story.  The film is also very nice to look at, which certainly helps the atmosphere.  The story is about this virus that spreads and kills an entire platoon of soldiers, minus two, and how those sent to investigate the strange circumstances surrounding the deaths of the soldiers start to go through the same thing.  The film goes back and forth between the past and the present.  And this is where the film's problems first become evident.  They go back and forth between the present at a moment's notice without properly setting it up.  It would be fine if the intended effect was for it to be jarring, sort of like in Slaughterhouse Five where the main character lives through stages of his life at random moments.  He would be in his 20s, fighting in a war and the next moment he'd be on his deathbed.  In the case of that film, that jarring effect, helped the film as it accurately portrayed what the character must've been going through.  In the case of this film, I don't think that was the purpose.  The movie isn't confusing but it is hard to get into the movie when they go back and forth like it was going out of style.  I blame the editing.  The editing is just piss-poor and the scenes just don't flow together very well.  It was confusing and certainly very annoying.  It always took me a while before I figured out the timeline each time it went back.  I understand that the film wanted to go back only when something relevant to the ""present"" was happening, but that doesn't mean you should do it, especially when you do it as poorly as this film did.  It didn't really have to be that way because the rest of the film, while uninspired, certainly wasn't bad at all.  If it hadn't been for the editing during the times where the film went back to the past, it might've even been a good horror film.  I think it had the recipe to, at the very least, be a solid horror film.  Good atmosphere, gore, nice cinematography and decent acting.  That, to me, sounds like a good horror film.  Unfortunately, some of the technical aspects keep this film from reaching its true potential as it is really hard to get into a movie when it goes back and forth repeatedly with no rhyme or reason.",,,,,,,,

The story is not at fault here, nor are the costume. In fact, I believe the film is actually shot in the correct location (historically speaking) but I'd have to do research here.  Where this film falls flat is in the action.  Whoever put together the fighting sequences and military tactics and fighting styles couldn't have done their homework.  While being shot in a style that was common for decades, the actual warfare taking place here just looks as if the  filmmakers decided to just tell the actors to run at each other and make like they were killing someone.  Kinda reminds me of home video of people re-enacting Civil War battles. Not enough direction or training, too much mish mash.  And for 2 armies said to be some of the greatest in the history of man... mish mash doesn't make anybody look good.",,,,,,,,

Despite the title this is not a ""Toy Story"" rip off by any means. It's more in the liking of ""Home Alone"", but even that's being too generous. Whereas ""Home Alone"" while juvenile was fun through and through understanding it shouldn't attempt to be anything it's not. In ""Charlie: A Toy Story"" that's not the case. To the film credit it contains elements that could have made a decent movie; young child protagonist dealing with parental issues, childlike dad learning to grow up with his son, neglectful bully father-son relationship, and a message on family values. All these elements in context work to an extent. Firstly you have a child like dad who always presented as the fun one while the mother is always presented as the serious one. Both parents despite lacking depth are both painted in a positive and negative way. Neither is purely good or bad, but that won't excuse how cliche their arc turn out. The married couple mostly are shown on uneven grounds, but neither ever become elaborated on. A basic idea that remains basic with a predictable outcome. While a lesson in growing up and realizing your responsibility is a good one so are showing realistic problems with realistic solution. 

The second element are the bullies. Now these bullies follows all the rule of being family friendly bullies (an idiot and the leader) resorting to such horrible name calling like dog boy, moron, loser boy, and two usage of the word frickin. VAN DAMME it squeaky clean dialogue! This movie is too innocent in that department. Bullying has become more of an growing issue in recent years and the film representation is too by the numbers. Bullies in this film have lousy name calling, are incredibly inept (I know their kids, but what bully feels actual pain when getting shot with small marshmallow and confetti), and the only solution presented is too set simple traps around the small town. Sounds cool for a climax right? Well once again the film lacks inspiration in that department. Throughout the film the usage of traps have no real pay off even comedically these traps are rather pathetic. As for some backstory at least one of the bully gets somewhat justification for his action. That reason being a neglectful which the film spends far too little time on. Sure it sends the message of doing bad deeds is not the way to get a neglectful parent attention, but does not bother to show the hardship in fixing a family relationship. 

The third element I left out intentionally deal with the more supernatural and hinted religious overtone. Wait....what about Charlie? Isn't he after all the main character? Nope, in the film the name Charlie belongs to a dog who plays no major part in the story. I thought the dog would have come into play as a metaphor for the child protagonist to learn about taking care of another living creature, but it's just a side kick with no significance in the story. So baring with the film the magical elements are never justified to exist. These magical elements are only here because according to this film  ""all you gotta do is believe"". Now in the film the child like father creates the ultimate toy. It's basically a chest (called the ""Wondermation"") with the power to create any toy with the power of user imagination. This unexplained magical chest logistics gets a free pass from me since I have to face it how would anyone reasonably explain that working in a real world scenario. However, one thing that is not excusable are the usage of Angels. Yes, a film whose Christian undertone remain subtle comes out of left field with angels. Angles are never hinted at or even mentioned in the film. Not to forget the ending of this scene including angels tonally fits a psychological horror.

Director Gary A. Brown execution of the film is too simple. Everything from its lightning, one note visual style, and acting screams low budget limitations. There is not interesting shot as every shot is either a medium shot, medium long shot, or a close up. Occasionally cinematographer Chuck Hatcher will choose different shot sizes and his lack of effort makes for one dull looking film. Most of the dialogue is delivered awkwardly, either in a halting, tentative manner or in an over-enthusiastic rush. I blame bad direction for the uneven dialogue delivery. Rheagan Wallace for example emotes the right emotion for her one note role speeds through her line delivery. Almost of as if someone just wanted to end filming as soon as possible. The adult actors are fine in all respect. They don't add much personality to their roles, but do an adequate enough job that it doesn't feel lazy. Children actors on the other hand are bad. Not on bad direction, but simply because the child actors don't have any ideas they're filming a movie. Performance wise they look like they're having fun filming or bored not doing anything exciting. If you're the kind of person who can't stand bad child actors stay away from Raymond Ochoa in this film as his face never seems to change. Music of the film ranges okay to huh? According to the credits actor Tanner Fontana provided a song for the film. Of course I'm going to point out some bad lyrics. It goes like ""It's nap time. To celebrate all the good time. I put it all on the line every day that I'm alive."" I'm utterly speechless with those lyrics.

Charlie: A Toy Story has some heart, but all emotion all lost in a generic execution. While the end result just turned to be generic it wasn't as bad originally expected. For a straight to dvd family picture its not entirely insulting, its bearable thanks to some solid ideas, and has enough sustain itself to the end. True you could do a lot worse when it comes to family films, but why settle for less regardless of the audience intended.<>Charlie: A Toy Story is pretty much everything that audiences have come to expect from Engine 15 Productions with one obvious exception.  That exception is the movie's title.  While the movie bears the name of the family's dog, the movie is less about him and more about his young nine-year old companion, Caden (Raymond Ochoa).  It is a fitting film for any group of younger church goers with its obvious religious undertones.  And while its production values aren't exactly Hollywood caliber, the positive messages of faith and family make up for that, and make it a piece that is worth at least one watch. 

Charlie: A Toy Story is a rather misleading title for this feature, considering that the story is less about the dog, Charlie, than about his young companion, Caden.  Engine 15 isn't the first studio to ever use such a tactic.  So considering that, it can be forgiven.  That's because what's most important about this straight-to-DVD release isn't who is the real star, but its messages of faith and family.  The message of faith isn't an entirely overt one, but neither is it covert.  Caden's message to his father-who is divorced from his mother, who is ironically named Faith-is to always believe, even in the midst of a divorce and struggling o come up with a toy that could change Jack and his family's life forever.  This message is meant to be construed both in a secular and non-secular manner.  That it was able to incorporate the message without being too preachy helps the movie an easy watch both in a living room and in a Sunday school classroom.  

The message of faith is just one message that families and religious institutions will appreciate from Charlie: A Toy Story.  As noted already, the message of faith is linked directly to the family situation of Jack, Caden and Faith.  Jack and Faith are divorced, and Caden is caught in the middle of the pair.  Despite this, Caden has faith in his father, both in terms of his father's drive to invent a great toy and as a father.  This isn't the only family issue to which audiences are introduced.  Along with dealing with a broken family, Caden also has to deal with a bully named Scooter.  It turns out that Scooter is a bully because he has his own family problems.  As he has gotten older, he and his father Chip (Matthew Tompkins) have grown increasingly distant from one another.  Of course, being a family movie, both of these family situations are resolved thus leaving audiences with that standard warm, fuzzy feeling.

Both the messages of family and faith are integral to Charlie: A Toy Story.  They are messages that can be used to teach life lessons in the living room or a Sunday school classroom.  They are messages that can be related to any young viewer.  They are that relatable.  It's because of that ability of young viewers to relate to the movie's themes and messages that this will turn out to be a feature that will be worth watching by families at least once.","Garry A.

Everything about this film is poorly made: the storyline, the acting is dreadful, the dialogue is hilariously terrible, the picture quality is awful, the fight scenes are choreographed awkwardly...it's B-movie fun, overall. As cheesy and ridiculous the film is, it has a great deal of fun contained in it for a B-movie fanatic since it is all done with such energy. It's no masterpiece, but it works as a guilty pleasure.<>Fred Williamson is again in fine form as a Chicago cop protecting a photographer from a biker gang.  I only wish the Italian production values were as good.  Fred's handling of negotiations with criminals holding hostages is not to be missed.<>This was one of the most boring 'action' flicks I've ever seen, even Fred Williamson couldn't save it from yawns and obscurity.

Oh, and FYI, that cover image of a flaming city and all that other shit has nothing to do with the films itself, so don't get your hopes up.

Pass, unless your morbid curiosity gets the better of you.<>Wasn't Sylvester Stallone's ""Cobra"" bad enough? Did we really need a cheap Italian knock off of it? No we didn't but none-the-less the Italians thought it enough to rip it off and change the title just a bit to reflect its main star, cult icon Fred Williamson.

The plot is exactly like ""Cobra"". Sadistic gang going around brutally killing people for no apparent reason: check. Hot babe witnesses a murder and gets away without first seeing the face of the gang leader: check. Tough as nails cop assigned to protect her from the gang: check. Gang tries to murder the witness while she is in the hospital: check. Car chases: check. As you can see this is just ""Cobra"" with a lower budget and bad dubbing.

The main reason to see this film is for cult icon Fred Williamson but even he seems bored with the premises. He seems tired and wore out as the fight scenes are really poorly staged. He isn't even to get his likeable charm to shine through the silted dialogue as lines like ""I'd do it even if it was Santa Clauses' daughter"" come out more head ache inducing than unintentionally funny.

Director Stelvio Massi directed some decent Poliziotteschi films in the 70s but again like many of his director brethren his output in the 80s degrades to the Z-grade action level as this is a far cry from his superior 70s offerings. His directing just seems cheap and shoddy with poor zooms and pans. I understand he was working with nothing for a budget but he did nothing to try to heighten up the look of the film.

The worst part perhaps is the god damn score. We get one fucking piece, the same piece played over the opening credits, and it is the only piece of score played throughout the entire picture. That would be fine if it was a catchy, likeable score but it's not so it gets annoying really fast.

Like almost every other poliziotteschi film released in the 80s, ""Black Cobra"" weaves just above the line of god-awful and isn't even that fun for unintentional laughter. Williamonson looks bored and the directing is uninspired. For an Italian low-budget knock off this should have been a lot more fun than it was. Two sequels did follow (The Black Cobra 2, Black Cobra 3: Manila Connection) which are both MUCH better than this one. A fourth film entitled ""Detective Malone"" was also released but it was just a movie filmed around stock footage of Williamson from the first 3 films.

Bonus Rant: It was enough to rip-off ""Cobra"" but the writers decided also to lift some dialogue from ""Dirty Harry"". During the final gun battle, Willaimson's Malone character has the balls to say a slightly changed version of Dirty Harry's famous dialogue of how many bullets did he fire and if the thug feels lucky. Come on guys!

Note: The ""Black Cobra"" trilogy has fallen into public domain here in the United States and to be honest most of the releases are pure crap as they cram all three films onto a single layer DVD. The least crappy DVD release of these films is the triple feature from Diamond Entertainment which has all three films spread out on two discs, the second disc being dual layered so that means one film per layer! The transfer of the first ""Black Cobra"" though is still from a poor VHS source so only the most forgivable cult film fanatics, like me, are encouraged to hunt this DVD set down.<>Fred Williamson is again in fine form as a Chicago cop protecting a photographer from a biker gang.  I only wish the Italian production values were as good.

Supposedly set in the US but obviously filmed in Italy with a mostly Italian cast, this is entirely worthless except for the fact that Williamson's acting and the script's dialogue are so shamelessly cliched that they become laugh out loud funny at times.<>Not great, but I still find Fred Williamson to be amazing in this movie.

The acting is top notch, with Delon and Signoret in peak form.","Excellent Simenon adaptation is less crime thriller and rather a moving psychological drama with a tinge of romance.<>The strength of âLa veuve Coudercâ becomes apparent on many different levels. Not only does it paint a fascinating picture of the stereotypical contrasts of the countryside, but also of the developing relationship between Simone Signoret (the widow) and Alain Delon (the stranger). The idyllic pictures (with matching music) suggest that the countryside village we are looking at is the picture-postcard sort of place we would hope it to be. But once the taciturn residents are beginning to speak about the past and disclose their frustrations and old feuds, an entirely different picture crops up. Anyone having grown up in the country will recognize these repressed tensions that entirely ruin the rosy-eyed image of the naive outsider once his illusions have been shattered. As viewers, we identify with Delonâ(TM)s character, being the outsider looking for a job and a place to stay. Like him, we intuitively take to the character of the widow, who seems the most bonafide of all. Since the status quo at the village takes up all our attention, we almost forget to wonder about Delonâ(TM)s past, which appears to be not too inconsequential either. The director (Pierre Granier-Deferre) has done a great job diverting our focus here. The strangerâ(TM)s past and background prove to be very important later on, when the events are drawing to a close. Another element of thematic importance is the incubator that establishes the contact between the widow and the stranger in the first place (the object being very heavy, the stranger passing by volunteers his help in carrying it home for the widow). For a long time they canâ(TM)t seem to get it working, but in the end they succeed. This process symbolizes the relationship between the two people, who first have their frictions, but end up being a harmonious, well-functioning team (until the shit hits the fan â"" the shit being the interventions of the hostile villlage community, the widowâ(TM)s relatives in particular). There are many details that make this film worthwhile, like the young, simple-minded girl FÃ (C)licie, who has the wit of a cat, as well as its inclinations to nocturnal adventure seeking. As to be expected, things will inevitably happen once such a creature is allowed to leave home at nighttime. When the stranger (or any other man from the village, for that matter) gets intimate with her, we are not sure to consider this as rape or as a pleasurable kind of pastime for all parties involved. Strangely enough, we tend not to judge Delonâ(TM)s character for (ab)using her, like we donâ(TM)t seem to want to judge him for cheating on the widow or for his criminal past. This is a very intriguing, eye-opening film that well deserves a four-star rating. I suppose the success of this film may have caused the director of the film âLes granges brÃ»lÃ (C)esâ (which was made two years after âLa veuve Coudercâ) to choose Simone Signoret and Alain Delon to play yet another couple with a frictional relationship in a countryside setting.<>I love Movies that settle around Unorthodox Love Affairs and it also is a Shameless Grotueske on the French Land Folk",Raymond Danon,"Sep 15, 1971 wide",,International Cinefilm,,,,
